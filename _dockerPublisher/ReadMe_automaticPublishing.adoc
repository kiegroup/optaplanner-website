== Automatic publishing of optaplanner-website

*The Dockerfile constructs an image with all needed software to do*

* rake setup
* rake clean build
* rake publish

For building this image and run a container there is a job on https://kie-jenkins.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/view/Websites/job/optaplanner-website-automatic-publishing/[Jenkins CI]

Each time a commit is pushed to optaplanner-website (or directly or via a pullrequest) this job will be executed: +
a Docker image *[_droolsjbpm/optaplanner-website:latest_]* will be constructed and a container of this image will run.

Whithin this running container the rake tasks: *setup, clean build and publish* will be done.
