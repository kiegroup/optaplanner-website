  [.summaryParagraph]
  https://www.redhat.com[Red Hat] sponsors this Open Source project
  and employs its link:../community/team.html[core developers].
  Additionally, Red Hat offers enterprise support and consultancy for the enterprise version of this community project,
  as part of a Red Hat product subscription.

  To assist customers, Red Hat employs:

  - Solution architects that can define the best architecture for your scope and demonstrate the product functioning;
  - Services team with consultants and architects to help deliver reliable production implementations with Red Hat PAM;
  - A 24/7 support team.
  - and of course the OptaPlanner team itself to implement missing features of fix bugs.

  == Product subscription

  The Red Hat build of OptaPlanner, also known as https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/business-optimization[Business Optimizer],
  is included in the following product subscriptions:

  * https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/decision-manager[Red Hat Decision Manager]
  * https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/process-automation-manager[Red Hat Process Automation Manager]


  == Community and product comparison

  The community download delivers everything you would expect from an Open Source project,
  including all features. The product subscription fills the missing gaps for enterprise use.
  Both community and product use the same code base.
