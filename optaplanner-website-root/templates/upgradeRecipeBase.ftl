        <p><strong>OptaPlannerâ€™s public API classes are backwards compatible</strong> (per series),
            but users often also use impl classes (which are documented in the reference manual too).
            This upgrade recipe <em>minimizes the pain</em> to upgrade your code
            and to take advantage of <a href="${content.rootpath}docs/optaplanner/latest/release-notes/release-notes.html#releaseNotes-8.x">the newest features in OptaPlanner 8</a>.</p>

                    <span class="badge bg-danger label-as-badge">Major</span>
                    Likely to affect your code.

                <li>
                    <span class="badge bg-warning label-as-badge">Minor</span>
                    Unlikely to affect your code (especially if you followed the examples), unless you have hacks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="badge bg-info label-as-badge">Impl detail</span>
                    Will not affect your code, unless you have very deep hacks.

                <li>
                    <span class="badge bg-primary label-as-badge">Recommended</span>
                    Not a backward incompatible change, but you probably want to do this.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span class="badge bg-success label-as-badge">Readme</span>
                    Read this to better understand why the subsequent major changes were made.
