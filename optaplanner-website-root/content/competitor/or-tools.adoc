[.lead]
Google OR-Tools and OptaPlanner are open source mathematical optimization solvers.
They are both used across the globe in production.
But there are notable differences between OptaPlanner and Google OR-Tools.

[.lead]
OptaPlanner is <<unified,unified>>, <<customizable,customizable>>,
<<fasterAndMoreScalable,fast>>, <<fasterAndMoreScalable,scalable>> and
<<easyToUse,easy to use>> because of
<<objectOrientedProgrammingModel,OO models>>,
<<codeConstraint,constraints as code>> and
<<flexibleScoring,flexible scoring>>.
OptaPlanner is also <<easyToIntegrate, integration friendly>> (including REST)
and <<cloudReady,cloud ready>>. It runs on <<operationSystemIndependent,all operating systems>>
and has <<enterpriseSupport,enterprise support>>.

[#unified]
== OptaPlanner is a unified and consistent solver

Google OR-Tools has a separate solvers for Vehicle Routing (VRP), Constraint Programming (such as Employee Rostering), etc.
Each solver has their own APIs, their own learning curve, their own limitations and their own specific use cases.

OptaPlanner has a single, unified API that handles _any_ use case with _any_ combination of constraints.
It can solve hybrid problems, such as a Vehicle Routing Problem with a constraint
to distribute the workload fairly across drivers (a typical constraint of Employee Rostering).


[#customizable]
== OptaPlanner is a customizable solver

Google OR-Tools's VRP solver has a fixed list of constraints to choose from.

Most real-world VRP use cases share 80% of the constraints, such as capacity limits or time windows.
But unless the other 20% - the business specific hard constraints - are implemented,
your project will return infeasible solutions, making it 100% useless.

OptaPlanner supports a flexible constraint API that can handle any type of constraint.
VRP specific constraints - such as capacity limits or time windows -
are implemented just like any other constraint.
Therefore, it can handle any VRP variant, even those unique to your organization.

[#fasterAndMoreScalable]
== OptaPlanner is fast and scalable

// TODO Change to "OptaPlanner is both faster and more scalable than OR-Tools" after adding the open benchmarks as proof.
OptaPlanner is both fast and scalable
for planning and scheduling use cases, such as the link:../learn/useCases/vehicleRoutingProblem.html[Vehicle Routing Problem],
link:../learn/useCases/employeeRostering.html[Employee Rostering] and link:../learn/useCases/maintenanceScheduling.html[Maintenance scheduling].

OptaPlanner supports multi-threaded solving to take advantage of multiple CPU cores,
even for a single algorithm on a single dataset. OR-Tools's VRP solver doesn't.

OptaPlanner delivers better results, in the same amount of CPU time, even on a single CPU core.
It also consumes less memory when scaling out. Why? Because:

=== OptaPlanner uses a more efficient model

Under the covers, OR-Tools's CP solver and OptaPlanner use very different optimization technologies,
which impacts your modeling flexibility, which in turn impacts performance and scalability.

For example, in employee rostering, to assign shifts to employees:

* OR-Tools's CP solver creates a `boolean` variable for every `(shift, employee)` combination.
Given `2000` shifts and `100` employees, that's an array of `200 000` elements.
* On the other hand, OptaPlanner creates an `Employee` variable for every `Shift`.
Given `2000` shifts and `100` employees, that's an array of `2000` elements.

The OptaPlanner approach doesn't just scale better,
it also omits the _one shift per employee_ hard constraint which the model naturally enforces by design.

Ironically, OR-Tools's VRP solver is far more akin to OptaPlanner in this regard
than OR-Tools's CP solver.


[#easyToUse]
== OptaPlanner is easy to use

Any software developer can implement an optimization use case with OptaPlanner.
*There's no need to hire expensive consultants to write complex mathematical equations.*
It's OOP friendly.

Later, when your business reality changes, you can quickly adjust the OptaPlanner constraints.
It is maintenance friendly.

OptaPlanner supports both Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming:


[#objectOrientedProgrammingModel]
=== An OptaPlanner model is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) friendly

Both OR-Tools and OptaPlanner require you to define your model, with _optimization variables_,
so the mathematical optimization software knows which decisions it needs to make.

OR-Tools's CP solver supports 3 types of optimization variables: booleans, integers and floating point numbers.
You must transform your domain model into those types.
For example:

[source,java]
----
// Input
CpModel model = ...
IntVar[][] assignments = new IntVar[shifts.size()][employees.size()];
for (int s = 0; s < shifts.size(); s++) {
    for (int e = 0; e < employees.size(); e++) {
        assignments[s][e] = model.newBoolVar(...);
    }
}
... // Add constraints to enforce no shift is assigned to multiple employees

// Solve
solver.solve(model);

// Output
for (int s = 0; s < shifts.size(); s++) {
    for (int e = 0; e < employees.size(); e++) {
        if (value(assignments[s][e]) == 1L) {
            print(shifts[s] + " is assigned to " + employees[e]);
        }
    }
}
----

OR-Tools's VRP solver is even more limiting, because the type of the optimization variables are hard coded
in OR-Tools's `RoutingModel` class:

[source,java]
----
RoutingIndexManager manager = new RoutingIndexManager(locationListSize, vehicleListSize, 0);
RoutingModel routingModel = new RoutingModel(manager); // OR-Tools defined class
routingModel.setArcCostEvaluatorOfAllVehicles(...);
routingModel.addDimensionWithVehicleCapacity(...);

Assignment assignment = routingModel.solve();
long start = manager.indexToNode(routingModel.start(v));
long visit1 = assignment.value(routingModel.nextVar(internalIndex));
----

OptaPlanner supports any type of optimization variables,
including your custom classes (`Employee`, `Vehicle`, ...) or standard classes (`Boolean`, `Integer`, `BigDecimal`, `LocalDate`, ...).
You can reuse your existing domain model, to avoid costly data transformations.
For example:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningEntity
class Shift { // User defined class
    ... // Shift id, date, start time, required skills, ...

    @PlanningVariable
    Employee employee;
}
@PlanningSolution
class TimeTable { // User defined class
    List<Employee> employees;
    List<Shift> shifts;
}

// Input
Timetable timetable = new Timetable(shifts, employees);

// Solve
timetable = Solver.solve(timetable);

// Output
for (Shift shift : timetable.shifts) {
    print(shift + " is assigned to " + shift.employee);
}
----

*Neither of these 2 classes (`Shift` and `Timetable`) exist in OptaPlanner itself*: you define and shape them.
Your code doesn't deal with booleans and numbers, but uses `Employee`, `Shift` and `DayOfRequest` instances.
Your code reads naturally.

OptaPlanner even supports polymorphism.

[#codeConstraint]
=== OptaPlanner constraints are code, not equations

OR-Tools's CP solver constraints are implemented as *mathematical equations*.
For example, to assign _at most one shift per day_,
you add an equation `s1 + s2 + s3 \<= 1` for all shifts on day 1,
an equation `s4 + s5 \<= 1` for all shifts on day 2, and so forth:

[source,java]
----
for (int e = 0; e < employees.size(); e++) {
    for (int d = 0; d < dates.size(); d++) {
        IntVar[] vars = new IntVar[...];
        int i = 0;
        for (int s = 0; s < shifts.size(); s++) {
            // If the shift is on the date
            if (shifts[s].date == dates[d])) {
                vars[i++] = assignments[s][e];
            }
        }
        model.addLessOrEqual(LinearExpr.sum(vars), 1);
    }
}
----

OptaPlanner constraints are implemented as *programming code*.
If you use _ConstraintStreams_, a Functional Programming (FP) approach,
OptaPlanner automatically applies incremental score calculation with deltas
for maximum scalability and performance.

For example, to assign _at most one shift per day_,
select every pair of `Shift` instances
that have the same `date` and the same `employee`,
to penalize matching pairs as a hard constraint:

[source,java]
----
// For every shift ...
constraintFactory.forEach(Shift.class)
    // ... combined with any other shift ...
    .join(Shift.class,
        // ... on the same date ...
        equal(shift -> shift.date),
        // ... assigned to the same employee ...
        equal(shift -> shift.employee))
    // ... penalize one broken hard constraint per pair.
    .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD)
    .asConstraint("One shift per day");
----

That `equal()` method accepts _any_ code as a parameter to return _any_ type (not just booleans and numbers).

For example, because `date` is an instance of `LocalDate` (an advanced Date and Time API),
use `LocalDate.isDayOfWeek()` to select 2 shifts on the same day of week:

[source,java]
----
        // ... on the same day of week ...
        equal(shift -> shift.date.getDayOfWeek())
----

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY[Date and times arithmetic is notoriously difficult,]
because of Daylight Saving Time (DST), timezones, leap years and other semantics that only a few programmers on this planet actually understand.
OptaPlanner empowers you to directly use their APIs (such as `LocalDate`) in your constraints.

Besides the `equal()` joiner, OptaPlanner supplies `lessThan()`, `greaterThan()`, `lessThanOrEqual()`, `greaterThanOrEqual()`,
`overlapping()`, etc.
OptaPlanner automatically applies indexing (hashtable techniques) on joiners for performance.

For example, select two overlapping shifts with the `overlapping()` joiner
(even if they start or end at different times):

[source,java]
----
        // ... that overlap ...
        overlapping(shift -> shift.startDateTime, shift -> shift.endDateTime)
----

Besides the `join()` construct, OptaPlanner supports `filter()`, `groupBy()`, `ifExists()`, `ifNotExists()`, `map()`, etc.
This rich API empowers you to implement any constraint.

For example, allow employees that can work double shifts to work double shifts
by filtering out all employees that work double shifts with a `filter()`:

[source,java]
----
// For every shift ...
constraintFactory.forEach(Shift.class)
    // ... assigned to an employee that does not work double shifts ...
    .filter(shift -> !shift.employee.worksDoubleShifts)
    // ... combined with any other shift ...
    .join(Shift.class,
        equal(shift -> shift.date),
        // ... assigned to that same employee that does not work double shifts ...
        equal(shift -> shift.employee))
    .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD)
    .asConstraint("One shift per day");
----

The `groupBy()` construct supports `count()`, `sum()`, `average()`, `min()`, `max()`, `toList()`, `toSet()`, `toMap()`, etc.
You can also plug in custom collectors.

For example, don't assign more than 10 shifts to any employee by counting their shifts with `count()`:

[source,java]
----
constraintFactory.forEach(Shift.class)
    // Group shifts by employee and count the number of shifts per employee ...
    .groupBy(shift -> shift.employee, count())
    // ... if more than 10 shifts for one employee ...
    .filter((employee, shiftCount) -> shiftCount > 10)
    // ... penalize as a hard constraint ...
    .penalize(HardSoftScore.ONE_HARD,
            // ... multiplied by the number of excessive shifts.
            (employee, shiftCount) -> shiftCount - 10)
    .asConstraint("Too many shifts");
----

OptaPlanner allows weighting constraints dynamically.
It has *no linear limitations*.

For example, avoid overtime and distribute it *fairly* by penalizing the number of excessive hours *squared*:

[source,java]
----
constraintFactory.forEach(Shift.class)
    // Group shifts by employee and sum the shift duration per employee ...
    .groupBy(shift -> shift.employee, sum(shift -> shift.getDurationInHours()))
    // ... if an employee is working more hours than his/her contract ...
    .filter((employee, hoursTotal) -> hoursTotal > employee.contract.maxHours)
    // ... penalize as a soft constraint of weight 1000 ...
    .penalize(HardSoftScore.ofSoft(1000),
            // ... multiplied by the number of excessive hours squared.
            (employee, hoursTotal) -> {
                    int excessiveHours = hoursTotal - employee.contract.maxHours;
                    return excessiveHours * excessiveHours;
            })
    .asConstraint("Too many shifts");
----

This penalizes outliers more.
It automatically load balances overtime in fair manner across the employees,
whenever possible. https://www.optaplanner.org/blog/2017/02/03/FormulaForMeasuringUnfairness.html[Learn more.]

OptaPlanner also supports positive constraints: use `reward()` instead of `penalize()`.


[#flexibleScoring]
=== OptaPlanner has flexible scoring

OR-Tools's CP solver supports 2 score levels: hard constraints as _constraints_
and soft constraints as an _objective function_ that returns a floating point number.

If one soft constraint takes total priority over another soft constraint,
for example service quality constraints over productivity constraints,
OR-Tools's CP solver multiplies the first soft constraint by a big weight and sums that with the second.
This can lead to overflow or underflow.

OptaPlanner supports any number of score levels:

* 2 levels (default): hard and soft constraints with `HardSoftScore`
* 3 levels: hard, medium and soft constraints with `HardMediumSoftScore`
* n levels with `BendableScore`

This allows users to prioritize operational constraints (such as _assign all shifts_)
over financial constraints (such as _reduce cost_), without multiplication with a big number.

The OptaPlanner constraint weights can use:

* 32-bit integer (`int`) arithmetic (default) with `HardSoftScore`, etc.
* 64-bit integer (`long`) arithmetic with `HardSoftLongScore`, etc.
* Decimal number (`BigDecimal`) arithmetic with `HardSoftBigDecimalScore`, etc.

OptaPlanner actually no longer supports floating point (`double`) arithmetic
because of the numerical instability issues involved for incremental score calculation.


[#easyToIntegrate]
== OptaPlanner is easy to integrate with the REST, databases, etc

The https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner-quickstarts[OptaPlanner Quickstarts]
show how to integrate OptaPlanner with various technologies to quickly:

* Expose a REST service and JSON data with link:../compatibility/quarkus.html[Quarkus] or link:../compatibility/springBoot.html[Spring].
* Connect to a relational database with link:../compatibility/quarkus.html[Quarkus] or link:../compatibility/springBoot.html[Spring].
* Load balance solvers across multiple nodes with ActiveMQ.


[#cloudReady]
== OptaPlanner is cloud ready

OptaPlanner runs on all major clouds, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine and IBM Cloud.
It works on all major cloud technologies, such as Kubernetes, OpenShift, Docker and Virtual Machines.

But it just runs as fine on your local development machine without internet access,
or embedded in a process on-premise.

With link:../compatibility/quarkus.html[Quarkus] it can compile Java and Kotlin code natively for serverless use cases
that need to start up in milliseconds.


[#operationSystemIndependent]
== OptaPlanner runs on all major operating systems

OptaPlanner runs on all major operating systems, such as Linux, Windows and macOS.
There is no need to add a specific linux or Windows specific JAR in the classpath, depending on the operating system.


[#enterpriseSupport]
== OptaPlanner has enterprise support

Both OptaPlanner and OR-Tools are open source software under the link:../code/license.html[Apache License],
which allows free reuse for commercial purposes.
In both cases, their source code is available on https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner[GitHub].
Their communities are _open_. Their decision making is _open_.

A dedicated link:../community/team.html[core team] of optimization experts
(employed by https://www.redhat.com[Red Hat]) works full-time on OptaPlanner.
Also hundreds of external developers have contributed to OptaPlanner.
Regardless of who wrote the code, an(other) OptaPlanner core developer has reviewed it
before it is merged into the main repository.

Red Hat also offers link:../product/services.html[support and consulting services]
for customers who want to take their OptaPlanner implementation to the next level.
It is built on a strong, sustainable business model for open source.
