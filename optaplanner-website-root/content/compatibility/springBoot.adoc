If you're using Spring and want to add AI planning,
use the *OptaPlanner Spring Boot Starter* to get up and running quickly.
That starter has the same features as the link:quarkus.html[Quarkus] extension,
except for the typical Quarkus benefits (such as subsecond bootstrap performance and native compilation).

== Guide
