OptaPlanner is very often used by Kotlin programmers.

* OptaPlanner works on Kotlin.
* OptaPlanner has dedicated extensions for:
** link:quarkus.html[Quarkus]
** link:springBoot.html[Spring Boot]
* OptaPlanner is available in *Maven Central*.
Import the BOM (`org.optaplanner:optaplanner-bom`) in:
** Maven
** Gradle
* There is a feature request for nullability annotations on all APIs,
which we will add once Kotlin supports those from `jakarta.annotation:jakarta.annotation-api`.
