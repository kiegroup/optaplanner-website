OptaPlanner runs great on Kubernetes,
especially on https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[OpenShift].

Start a https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for OpenShift] to deploy one of the https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner-quickstarts[OptaPlanner Quickstarts] to it.
Every `use-cases` quickstart has README instructions on how to easily deploy it on OpenShift.
