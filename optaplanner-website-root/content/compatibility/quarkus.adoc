The https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] extension for OptaPlanner enriches
your project with the typical _supersonic subatomic Java_ benefits, such as:

- Instantaneous refresh during development
- Increased performance (both bootstrap and runtime)
- Reduced memory usage
- Native executable compilation (optional)
