https://www.optapy.org[OptaPy] allows you to run OptaPlanner from plain Python code.

* OptaPy is currently an experimental module.
It works, but it is at least 20 slower than OptaPlanner itself.
We're working on reducing this performance difference.
* OptaPy is https://pypi.org/project/optapy/[available in PyPI].
