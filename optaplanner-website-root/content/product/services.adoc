:showtitle:

[.summaryParagraph]
https://www.redhat.com[Red Hat] sponsors this Open Source project
and employs its link:../community/team.html[core developers].
Additionally, Red Hat offers enterprise support and consultancy for the enterprise version of this community project,
as part of a Red Hat product subscription.

To assist customers, Red Hat employs:

- Solution architects that can define the best architecture for your scope and demonstrate the product functioning;
- Services team with consultants and architects to help deliver reliable production implementations with Red Hat PAM;
- A 24/7 support team.
- and of course the OptaPlanner team itself to implement missing features or fix bugs.

== Product subscription

Contact Red Hat for more information on product subscriptions that contain OptaPlanner.

== Community and product comparison

The community download delivers everything you would expect from an Open Source project,
including all features. The product subscription fills the missing gaps for enterprise use.
Both community and product use the same code base.
