OptaPlanner is a good base for metaheuristics research. Read about some of the advantages in
http://www.orcomplete.com/research/geoffrey-de-smet/open-source-metaheuristics-research-on-drools-planner[this article].
Especially https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpcPEieU3Cg[OptaPlanner Benchmarker] and our big set of already implemented use cases,
make it easy to test your new algorithm objectively against the existing algorithms.
