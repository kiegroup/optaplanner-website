Drools is an extremely fast _rule engine_.
Under the hood, OptaPlanner has used Drools as a _score engine_ for ages.
Today, we're announcing *a faster, lightweight alternative*: Bavet.

Bavet is a feature of OptaPlanner. It is *not a rule engine*.
It is a pure, single-purpose, incremental *score calculation implementation*
of the https://www.optaplanner.org/blog/2020/04/07/ConstraintStreams.html[ConstraintStreams API].
Bavet is _feature complete_ as of OptaPlanner `8.27.0.Final`.
You can switch from Drools to Bavet in a single line of code.

Twice as fast score calculation. Zero API changes.

== Faster

For 20 diverse use cases, we compared Bavet and Drools for OptaPlanner score calculation.
We ran JMH benchmarks
on OpenJDK 17 (`ParallelGC`, `Xmx1G`)
on a stable benchmark machine (`Intel® Xeon® Silver (12 cores total / 24 threads)` and `128 GiB` RAM memory)
without any other computational demanding processes running.

On average, *Bavet is twice as fast as Drools* for score calculation.
In the https://www.optaplanner.org/learn/useCases/vehicleRoutingProblem.html[Vehicle Routing Problem],
Bavet is even three times as fast as Drools:

// TODO Update table, put Drools first, percentage -= 100, switch rows/columns?

// TODO Graph!

Bavet is faster than Drools for almost every use case.
Of course, your mileage may vary.
Turn on Bavet and if it's not faster in your use case, https://groups.google.com/g/optaplanner-dev[let us know].

Drools and Bavet are both still improving.
And we have some crazy ideas for a nextgen score calculation implementation
that uses https://github.com/quarkusio/gizmo[Gizmo]
to generate domain-specific Bavet-like nodes.
This performance race is far from over.

== Scaling

Does Bavet scale well?

On commodity hardware, we ran a 5 minutes VRP benchmark on different dataset sizes,
to compare how Drools and Bavet scale up:

|===

Same story, but the performance gap does close as the scale goes up.

== Not a rule engine

*Bavet is _not_ a rule engine.*
It deliberately doesn't support _inference_, nor Complex Event Processing (CEP),
nor other common business rule engine features:

image:ruleEngineScoreEngineScope.png[Rule Engine versus Score Engine scope]

OptaPlanner only requires a score engine.
Its Drools implementation only uses a small subset of Drools's features.
Bavet on the other hand, is a score engine tailored to OptaPlanner.
It's part of OptaPlanner. It has no use outside of OptaPlanner.

For incremental score calculation, Bavet borrows techniques from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_algorithm[the RETE algorithm]
and Drools's Phreak algorithm.
For example, the https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner/blob/main/core/optaplanner-constraint-streams-bavet/src/main/java/org/optaplanner/constraint/streams/bavet/common/AbstractJoinNode.java[JoinNode in Bavet]
contains `insert()`, `update()` and `retract()`  methods.
But below the surface, it's a very different implementation.
Compare it with the method signatures of similar methods in the https://github.com/kiegroup/drools/blob/main/drools-core/src/main/java/org/drools/core/phreak/PhreakJoinNode.java[JoinNode in Drools].

== History and naming

I created Bavet as a https://github.com/ge0ffrey/bavet-experiment[POC] in 2019
and added it into OptaPlanner as an experimental, fast, incomplete feature.
There it sat frozen. For 3 years.
Until recently, when Lukáš Petrovický and me completed all missing features
and refactored it to the performance sensation is today.

Naming wise, _bavet_ is a Flemish (Dutch) slang word for a _bib_.
Very useful if your baby is drooling.
I came up with that name when we were eating with our kids at a spaghetti restaurant called Bavet,
while facing this mural:

image:bavetEinsteinMural.png[Bavet mural]

Ok, maybe I didn't put much effort into that.

But it doesn't really need a good name.
It's just one of OptaPlanner's score calculation options.
An implementation detail, really.

== Stability

We believe Bavet is very stable.
We successfully run our 48+ hours stress tests on Bavet regularly.
These stress tests stomp out score corruption by solving a lot of datasets across many use cases.

== More lightweight

In OpenShift and Kubernetes clouds, the size of pods matter.
By using Bavet, you can slim down OptaPlanner's classpath
to exclude the Drools dependencies.

On the OptaPlanner https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner-quickstarts/tree/stable/hello-world[hello-world quickstart],
a Maven assembly of `jar-with-dependencies` is 60% smaller with Bavet only:

image:bavetDistributionSizeChart.png[Distribution size of jar-with-dependencies on OptaPlanner's hello-world]

.Distribution size of jar-with-dependencies on OptaPlanner's hello-world
[cols="2,>1,>1,4"]
|===
|Core dependencies |Size |Reduction |Core exclusions

|All (default) |17.5{nbsp}MB |0% |none
|Drools CS only |17.1{nbsp}MB |-2% |`optaplanner-constraint-drl`, `optaplanner-constraint-streams-bavet`
|Bavet CS only |7.0{nbsp}MB |-60% |`optaplanner-constraint-drl`, `optaplanner-constraint-streams-drools`
|===

By default, `optaplanner-core` includes both Drools and Bavet,
so you have to explicitly exclude it in Maven or Gradle:

[source, xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.optaplanner</groupId>
      <artifactId>optaplanner-core</artifactId>
      <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
          <groupId>org.optaplanner</groupId>
          <artifactId>optaplanner-constraint-drl</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
        <exclusion>
          <groupId>org.optaplanner</groupId>
          <artifactId>optaplanner-constraint-streams-drools</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
      </exclusions>
    </dependency>
----

This reduces `optaplanner-core` from 42 to 17 transitive dependencies.
Specifically, all these jars are removed from your classpath:

Bavet (`optaplanner-constraint-streams-bavet`) has no transitive dependencies
(except for `optaplanner-constraint-streams-common`).

== Try it out

First upgrade to OptaPlanner `8.27.0.Final` or later, if you haven't already.
If you're using the deprecated `scoreDRL` approach, https://www.optaplanner.org/download/upgradeRecipe/drl-to-constraint-streams-migration.html[migrate from scoreDRL to constraint streams] first.

*By default, OptaPlanner still uses Drools for constraint streams.*
To use Bavet instead, explicitly switch the `ConstraintStreamImplType` to `BAVET`:

=== Plain Java

Switch to Bavet in either your `*.java` file:

[source, java]
----
SolverFactory<TimeTable> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(new SolverConfig()
        ...
        .withConstraintStreamImplType(ConstraintStreamImplType.BAVET)
        ...);
----

or in your `solverConfig.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
  <scoreDirectorFactory>
    ...
    <constraintStreamImplType>BAVET</constraintStreamImplType>
  </scoreDirectorFactory>
----

=== Quarkus

Switch to Bavet in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

[source, java]
----
quarkus.optaplanner.solver.constraintStreamImplType=BAVET
----

=== Spring

Switch to Bavet in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

[source, java]
----
optaplanner.solver.constraintStreamImplType=BAVET
----

== Share your results

Help us out. Try Bavet and *https://groups.google.com/g/optaplanner-dev/c/BqwbHbBJbns[let us know here]
how your _score calculation speed_ changes*.
Look for the score calculation speed in the `INFO` log: it's part of the `Solving ended` message.

== Red Hat support

A Red Hat support subscription will not offer support for Bavet.
Drools intends to catch up performance wise.
