= Upgrade recipe 8
:jbake-type: upgradeRecipeBase
:jbake-description: Upgrade to OptaPlanner 8 from the previous version.
:jbake-priority: 0.5
:jbake-upgrade_recipe_version: 8

== From 7.48+ to 8.0.0.Final

Because this is a new major version number (8.0), which is the foundation for the 8.x series for the next few years,
it allows us to make backwards incompatible changes to the public API _for the long term benefit of this project_.

We kept these backwards incompatible changes to a strict minimum
and will not introduce any additional ones during the 8.x era.

Any backwards incompatible changes are annotated with a [.badge.label-as-badge.bg-public-api]#Public API# badge.

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== Java 11 or higher required

If you're using JRE or JDK 8, upgrade to JDK 11 or higher.

JDK 11 or higher is still available for _free_ (including security and bug fixes),
alongside Oracle's paid subscription.

* On linux, get OpenJDK from your linux software repository.
For example on Fedora and RHEL:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo dnf install java-11-openjdk-devel
----

* On Windows and macOS, https://adoptium.net[download OpenJDK from Adoptium].

We currently intend to support a minimal version of Java 11 throughout the entire 8.x series.

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SolverFactory` and `PlannerBenchmarkFactory` no longer support KIE containers

The KIE container concept no longer applies.
Therefore, `SolverFactory` no longer allows to create `Solver` instances from KIE containers.
Likewise for `PlannerBenchmarkFactory` and benchmarks.

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== OSGi metadata removed

Due to the limited usage of OSGi and the maintenance burden it brings, the OptaPlanner jars in the 8.x series no longer include OSGi metadata in their `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file.

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== Refrain from using Java serialization

Java serialization is
https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/amber/serialization.html[considered by its authors to be poorly designed] and it was suggested that the capability would, at some point in time, be removed from the platform altogether.
In OptaPlanner 8, we have removed most uses of the `Serializable` marker interface from the public API and we encourage users to
https://www.optaplanner.org/docs/optaplanner/latest/integration/integration.html#integrationWithPersistentStorage[serialize
via JSON or other formats].

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SolverFactory.getScoreDirectorFactory()` replaced by `ScoreManager`

In version 7 of OptaPlanner, using `ScoreDirectorFactory` was necessary in order to
https://www.optaplanner.org/docs/optaplanner/latest/score-calculation/score-calculation.html#explainingTheScore[explain the score].
In version 8, we have added new functionality to the `ScoreManager` and as a result, there is no longer any reason to create new instances of `ScoreDirector`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
ScoreDirectorFactory<CloudBalance> scoreDirectorFactory = solverFactory.getScoreDirectorFactory();
try (ScoreDirector<CloudBalance> scoreDirector = scoreDirectorFactory.buildScoreDirector()) {
    scoreDirector.setWorkingSolution(solution);
    Score score = scoreDirector.calculateScore();
}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
ScoreManager<CloudBalance> scoreManager = ScoreManager.create(solverFactory);
Score score = scoreManager.updateScore(solution);
----

Methods that allowed users to retrieve an instance of `ScoreDirector` and `ScoreDirectorFactory` have been removed from public API without replacement.
A reduced version of the `ScoreDirector` interface was promoted to public API as part of promoting the
`ProblemFactChange` interface to public API.

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SolverFactory`: `getSolverConfig()` removed

The method `SolverFactory.getSolverConfig()` has long been deprecated in favor of `SolverFactory.create(SolverConfig)`.
A `SolverConfig` is now instantiated before a `SolverFactory` is instantiated, which is more natural.
The old way has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(".../mySolverConfig.xml");
SolverConfig solverConfig = solverFactory.getSolverConfig();
...
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource(".../mySolverConfig.xml");
...
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

If you were also passing a `ClassLoader`, pass it to both `SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource()` and `SolverFactory.create()`.

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SolverConfig`: `buildSolver()` removed

The method `SolverConfig.buildSolver()` is an inner method that doesn't belong in the public API.
Instead, use `SolverFactory.buildSolver()`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource(".../mySolverConfig.xml");
...
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverConfig.buildSolver();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource(".../mySolverConfig.xml");
...
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `PlannerBenchmarkConfig`: `buildPlannerBenchmark()` removed

The method `PlannerBenchmarkConfig.buildPlannerBenchmark()` is an inner method that doesn't belong in the public API.
Instead, use `PlannerBenchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark()`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkConfig benchmarkConfig = PlannerBenchmarkConfig.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingBenchmarkConfig.xml");
...
PlannerBenchmark benchmark = benchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkConfig benchmarkConfig = PlannerBenchmarkConfig.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingBenchmarkConfig.xml");
...
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.create(benchmarkConfig);
PlannerBenchmark benchmark = benchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark();
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SolverFactory`: `cloneSolverFactory()` removed

The method `SolverFactory.cloneSolverFactory()` has long been deprecated in favor of the copy constructor
`new SolverConfig(SolverConfig)`.
It has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
private SolverFactory<MySolution> base;

public void userRequest(..., long userInput) {
    SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = base.cloneSolverFactory();
    solverFactory.getSolverConfig()
            .getTerminationConfig()
            .setMinutesSpentLimit(userInput);
    Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
    ...
}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
private SolverConfig base;

public void userRequest(..., long userInput) {
    SolverConfig solverConfig = new SolverConfig(base); // Copy it
    solverConfig.getTerminationConfig()
            .setMinutesSpentLimit(userInput);
    SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
    Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
    ...
}
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SolverFactory`: `createEmpty()` removed

The method `SolverFactory.createEmpty()` has long been deprecated in favor of `new SolverConfig()`.
It has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createEmpty();
SolverConfig solverConfig = solverFactory.getSolverConfig()
...
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = new SolverConfig();
...
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== XML <solver/> root element now belongs to the https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver namespace
OptaPlanner now provides an XML Schema Definition for the solver configuration.
Although OptaPlanner keeps backward compatibility of the existing XML configuration,
migrating to the XSD is strongly recommended as OptaPlanner may support only valid configuration XML in the future.

Before in `*SolverConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<solver>
  ...
</solver>
----

After in `*SolverConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<solver xmlns="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  ...
</solver>
----

Using the XSD may require reordering some of the XML elements of the configuration.
Use code completion in the IDE to migrate to a valid XML.

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== Property `subPillarEnabled` in move selector configuration has been removed

The `subPillarEnabled` property on `PillarSwapMoveSelector` and `PillarChangeMoveSelector` has long been deprecated and replaced by a new property, `subPillarType`.
It has now been removed.

Before in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
      <pillar...MoveSelector>
        ...
        <pillarSelector>
          <subPillarEnabled>false</subPillarEnabled>
          ...
        </pillarSelector>
        ...
      </pillar...MoveSelector>
----

After in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
      <pillar...MoveSelector>
        <subPillarType>NONE</subPillarType>
        <pillarSelector>
          ...
        </pillarSelector>
        ...
      </pillar...MoveSelector>
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `Solver`: `getScoreDirectorFactory()` removed

The method `getScoreDirectorFactory()` has long been deprecated and has now been removed from both `Solver` and
`SolverFactory` classes.

Now you don't need to create a `Solver` instance just to calculate or explain a score in the UI.
Instead, use the `ScoreManager` API.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<VehicleRoutingSolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(...);
Solver<VehicleRoutingSolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
uiScoreDirectorFactory = solver.getScoreDirectorFactory();
...
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<VehicleRoutingSolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(...);
ScoreManager<VehicleRoutingSolution> scoreManager = ScoreManager.create(solverFactory);
...
----

`ScoreDirectorFactory` should not be used anymore, as it's always been outside the public API and all of its functionality is exposed in various parts of the public API.


[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `Solver.explainBestScore()` removed

The `explainBestScore()` method on the `Solver` interface has been deprecated in 7.x and now removed.
The same information can be obtained via the new `ScoreManager` API.

We continue to advise users not to parse the results of this method call in any way.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
solver = ...;
scoreExplanation = solver.explainBestScore();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
MySolution solution = ...;
ScoreManager<MySolution> scoreManager = ...;
scoreExplanation = scoreManager.explainScore(solution);
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== ``Solver``’s `getBestSolution()`, `getBestScore()` and `getTimeMillisSpent()` removed

Several methods on the `Solver` interface have been deprecated in 7.x and now removed.
The same information can be obtained by registering an `EventListener` via `Solver.addEventListener(...)`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
solver = ...;
solution = solver.getBestSolution();
score = solver.getBestScore();
timeMillisSpent = solver.getTimeMillisSpent();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
solver = ...;
solver.addEventListener(event -> {
    solution = event.getNewBestSolution();
    score = event.getNewBestScore();
    timeMillisSpent = event.getTimeMillisSpent();
});
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== Annotation scanning has been removed

The `<scanAnnotatedClasses/>` directive in solver configuration has been deprecated in 7.x and now removed.
Use the link:../../compatibility/quarkus.html[Quarkus extension] or
link:../../compatibility/springBoot.html[Spring Boot starter] to automatically scan for annotated classes instead.

Before in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<solver>
    ...
    <scanAnnotatedClasses/>
    ...
</solver>
----

After in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<solver>
    ...
    <solutionClass>...</solutionClass>
    <entityClass>...</entityClass>
    ...
</solver>
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== New package for `@PlanningFactProperty` and `@PlanningFactCollectionProperty`

The `@PlanningFactProperty` and `@PlanningFactCollectionProperty` now share the same package with other similar annotations, such as `@PlanningSolution`.
The old annotations have been deprecated in 7.x and now removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.solution.drools.ProblemFactCollectionProperty;
import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.solution.drools.ProblemFactProperty;
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.solution.ProblemFactCollectionProperty;
import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.solution.ProblemFactProperty;
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `filterClassList` replaced by a single filterClass

The configuration of `EntitySelector`, `ValueSelector` and `MoveSelector` now has a single filter class in both the configuration API and the solver configuration XML.

In practice, you don't need multiple selection filter classes often, and you can always replace them by a single selection filter class which implements the logic of all of them.
Passing a single selection class now requires less boilerplate code.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
ValueSelectorConfig valueSelectorConfig = new ValueSelectorConfig();
valueSelectorConfig.setFilterClassList(Collections.singletonList(MySelectionFilterClass.class));
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
ValueSelectorConfig valueSelectorConfig = new ValueSelectorConfig();
valueSelectorConfig.setFilterClass(MySelectionFilterClass.class);
----

==== Replacing multiple selection filter classes with a single one

Before in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<swapMoveSelector>
  <entitySelector>
    <filterClass>com.example.FilterA</filterClass>
    <filterClass>com.example.FilterB</filterClass>
  </entitySelector>
</swapMoveSelector>
----

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
package com.example;
...
public class FilterA implements SelectionFilter<MySolution, MyPlanningEntity> {

    @Override
    public boolean accept(ScoreDirector<MySolution> scoreDirector, MyPlanningEntity selection) {
        return selection.getValue() < 500;
    }
}
----

[source,java]
----
package com.example;
...
public class FilterB implements SelectionFilter<MySolution, MyPlanningEntity> {

    @Override
    public boolean accept(ScoreDirector<MySolution> scoreDirector, MyPlanningEntity selection) {
        return selection.getOrder() == Order.ASC;
    }
}
----

After in `*.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<swapMoveSelector>
  <entitySelector>
    <filterClass>com.example.SingleEntityFilter</filterClass>
  </entitySelector>
</swapMoveSelector>
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
package com.example;
...
public class SingleEntityFilter implements SelectionFilter<MySolution, MyPlanningEntity> {

    @Override
    public boolean accept(ScoreDirector<MySolution> scoreDirector, MyPlanningEntity selection) {
        return selection.getValue() < 500 && selection.getOrder() == Order.ASC;
    }
}
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== `AcceptorConfig` renamed to LocalSearchAcceptorConfig

Impacts only configuration API, solver configuration XML remains intact.

Naming consistency with other local-search-specific configuration classes.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
LocalSearchPhaseConfig localSearchPhaseConfig = new LocalSearchPhaseConfig()
        .withAcceptorConfig(new AcceptorConfig().withEntityTabuSize(5));
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
LocalSearchPhaseConfig localSearchPhaseConfig = new LocalSearchPhaseConfig()
        .withAcceptorConfig(new LocalSearchAcceptorConfig().withEntityTabuSize(5));
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `Custom properties` XML configuration format changes

Impact only the solver configuration XML, specifically `<scoreDirectorFactory/>`, `<moveIteratorFactory/>`,
`<moveListFactory/>`, `<partitionedSearch/>` and `<customPhase/>`.

To enforce structure of the configuration XML in build time.

Before in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<partitionedSearch>
  <solutionPartitionerClass>com.example.MySolutionPartitioner</solutionPartitionerClass>
  <solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
    <partCount>4</partCount> <!-- a custom property -->
    <minimumProcessListSize>300</minimumProcessListSize> <!-- a custom property -->
  </solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
</partitionedSearch>
----

After in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<partitionedSearch>
  <solutionPartitionerClass>com.example.MySolutionPartitioner</solutionPartitionerClass>
  <solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
    <property name="partCount" value="4"/> <!-- a custom property -->
    <property name="minimumProcessListSize" value="300"/> <!-- a custom property -->
  </solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
</partitionedSearch>
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `<variableNameInclude/>` elements are now wrapped by the `<variableNameIncludes/>` element

Impact only the solver configuration XML, specifically the `<swapMoveSelector/>` and `<pillarSwapMoveSelector/>`.

To enforce structure of the configuration XML in build time.

Before in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<swapMoveSelector>
  <variableNameInclude>variableA</variableNameInclude>
  <variableNameInclude>variableB</variableNameInclude>
</swapMoveSelector>
----

After in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<swapMoveSelector>
  <variableNameIncludes>
    <variableNameInclude>variableA</variableNameInclude>
    <variableNameInclude>variableB</variableNameInclude>
  </variableNameIncludes>
</swapMoveSelector>
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `Solution` interface removed

`Solution` interface has long been deprecated for removal and has now been removed.
The same goes for `AbstractSolution`, only used by the Workbench.

Remove the `Solution` interface, annotate the `getScore()` method with `@PlanningScore`
and replace the `getProblemFacts()` method with a `@ProblemFactCollectionProperty` annotation directly on every problem fact getter (or field).

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance implements Solution<HardSoftScore> {

    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;
    ...

    private HardSoftScore score;

    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    public List<CloudComputer> getComputerList() {...}

    public HardSoftScore getScore() {...}
    public void setScore(HardSoftScore score) {...}

    public Collection<? extends Object> getProblemFacts() {
        List<Object> facts = new ArrayList<Object>();
        facts.addAll(computerList);
        ...
        return facts;
    }

}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance {

    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;
    ...

    private HardSoftScore score;

    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    @ProblemFactCollectionProperty
    public List<CloudComputer> getComputerList() {...}

    @PlanningScore
    public HardSoftScore getScore() {...}
    public void setScore(HardSoftScore score) {...}

}
----

For a single problem fact (which is not wrapped in a `Collection`), use the `@ProblemFactProperty` annotation, as shown below (with field annotations this time).

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance implements Solution<HardSoftScore> {

    private CloudParametrization parametrization;
    private List<CloudBuilding> buildingList;
    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;
    ...

    public Collection<? extends Object> getProblemFacts() {
        List<Object> facts = new ArrayList<Object>();
        facts.add(parametrization); // not a Collection
        facts.addAll(buildingList);
        facts.addAll(computerList);
        ...
        return facts;
    }

}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance {

    @ProblemFactProperty
    private CloudParametrization parametrization;
    @ProblemFactCollectionProperty
    private List<CloudBuilding> buildingList;
    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    @ProblemFactCollectionProperty
    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;
    ...

}
----

Don't add the `@ProblemFactCollectionProperty` annotation on getters (or fields) that have a `@PlanningEntityCollectionProperty` annotation.

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `BestSolutionChangedEvent`: `isNewBestSolutionInitialized()` removed

The method `BestSolutionChangedEvent.isNewBestSolutionInitialized()` has long been deprecated in favor of `BestSolutionChangedEvent.getNewBestSolution().getScore().isSolutionInitialized()`.
It has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    public void bestSolutionChanged(BestSolutionChangedEvent<CloudBalance> event) {
        if (event.isEveryProblemFactChangeProcessed()
                && event.isNewBestSolutionInitialized()) {
            ...
        }
    }
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    public void bestSolutionChanged(BestSolutionChangedEvent<CloudBalance> event) {
        if (event.isEveryProblemFactChangeProcessed()
                && event.getNewBestSolution().getScore().isSolutionInitialized()) {
            ...
        }
    }
----

However, if you also check `isFeasible()`, that's enough because it also checks if the solution is initialized.

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    public void bestSolutionChanged(BestSolutionChangedEvent<CloudBalance> event) {
        if (event.isEveryProblemFactChangeProcessed()
                // isFeasible() checks isSolutionInitialized() too
                && event.getNewBestSolution().getScore().isFeasible()) {
            ...
        }
    }
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `<valueSelector>`: `variableName` is now an attribute

When power tweaking move selectors, such as `<changeMoveSelector>`, in a use case with multiple planning variables, the `<variableName>` XML element has been replaced by a `variableName="..."` XML attribute.
This reduces the solver configuration verbosity.
After being deprecated for the entire 7.x series, the old way has now been removed.

Before in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
  <valueSelector>
    <variableName>room</variableName>
  </valueSelector>
----

After in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
  <valueSelector variableName="room"/>
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== Partitioned Search: `threadFactoryClass` removed

Now that `<solver>` has supported a `<threadFactoryClass>` element for a while, the `<threadFactoryClass>` element under `<partitionedSearch>` has been removed.

Before in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
  <solver>
    ...
    <partitionedSearch>
      <threadFactoryClass>...MyAppServerThreadFactory</threadFactoryClass>
      ...
    </partitionedSearch>
  </solver>
----

After in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
  <solver>
    <threadFactoryClass>...MyAppServerThreadFactory</threadFactoryClass>
    ...
    <partitionedSearch>
      ...
    </partitionedSearch>
  </solver>
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SimpleDoubleScore` and `HardSoftDoubleScore` removed

The use of double-based score types has https://www.optaplanner.org/docs/optaplanner/latest/score-calculation/score-calculation.html#avoidFloatingPointNumbersInScoreCalculation[long been frowned upon]
as it leads to score corruption.
They have finally been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class MyPlanningSolution {

    private SimpleDoubleScore score;

    ...

}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class MyPlanningSolution {

    private SimpleLongScore score;

    ...

}
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `Score.toInitializedScore()` removed

The `Score.toInitializedScore()` method has been deprecated in favor of `Score.withInitScore(int)` in 7.x, and now removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
score = score.toInitializedScore();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
score = score.withInitScore(0);
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== Various justification `Comparators` removed

The following `Comparator` implementations were deprecated in 7.x and now removed:

- `org.optaplanner.core.api.score.comparator.NaturalScoreComparator`
- `org.optaplanner.core.api.score.constraint.ConstraintMatchScoreComparator`
- `org.optaplanner.core.api.score.constraint.ConstraintMatchTotalScoreComparator`
- `org.optaplanner.core.api.score.constraint.IndictmentScoreComparator`

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
NaturalScoreComparator comparator = new NaturalScoreComparator();
ConstraintMatchScoreComparator comparator2 = new ConstraintMatchScoreComparator();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
Comparator<Score> comparator = Comparable::compareTo;
Comparator<ConstraintMatch> comparator2 = Comparator.comparing(ConstraintMatch::getScore);
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `FeasibilityScore` removed

The `FeasibilityScore` interface has been deprecated in 7.x and its only method `isFeasible()` moved to the `Score`
supertype.
The interface has now been removed.

Users should refer to their ``Score``s by their ultimate type, for example `HardSoftScore` as opposed to `Score`.

=== `@PlanningEntity.movableEntitySelectionFilter` removed

The `movableEntitySelectionFilter` field on `@PlanningEntity` annotation has been deprecated in 7.x and a new field
`pinningFilter` has been introduced, the name of which bears a clear relation to the `@PlanningPin` annotation.
This filter implements a new `PinningFilter` interface, returning true if the entity is pinned, and false if movable.
The logic of this new filter is therefore inverted as compared to the old filter.

Users should update their `@PlanningEntity` annotations, supplying the new filter instead of the old.
The old field has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningEntity(movableEntitySelectionFilter = MyMovableEntitySelectionFilter.class)
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningEntity(pinningFilter = MyPinningFilter.class)
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `@PlanningVariable.reinitializeVariableEntityFilter` removed

The `reinitializeVariableEntityFilter` field on `@PlanningVariable` annotation has been deprecated for removal in 7.x and now removed.

Users of this niche functionality should refer to the documentation on how to achieve the same result by
link:https://www.optaplanner.org/docs/optaplanner/latest/planner-configuration/planner-configuration.html#nullablePlanningVariable[power-tweaking construction heuristics].

=== `*ScoreHolder` classes turned into interfaces

In OptaPlanner 7, `ScoreHolder` classes, used exclusively for
https://www.optaplanner.org/docs/optaplanner/latest/drools-score-calculation/drools-score-calculation.html[Drools score calculation], exposed a number of public methods which, if used, allowed the user to unintentionally corrupt or otherwise negatively affect their scores.

In OptaPlanner 8, these methods have been removed and the classes have been turned into interfaces.
You probably don't use any of the removed, potentially harmful methods, so there will be no impact on your code.

If that is not the case, you will find suitable replacements in the public API in areas of
https://www.optaplanner.org/docs/optaplanner/latest/score-calculation/score-calculation.html#explainingTheScore[score explanation] and
https://www.optaplanner.org/docs/optaplanner/latest/score-calculation/score-calculation.html#constraintConfiguration[constraint configuration].

[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== `ValueRangeFactory` class now final

`ValueRangeFactory` class is a factory class that has only static methods.
As such, there is no need for the users to extend this class, and it has therefore been made `final`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
class MyValueRangeFactory extends ValueRangeFactory {
    ...
}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
class MyValueRangeFactory {
    ...
}
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `ConstraintMatchTotal` and `Indictment` are now interfaces

`ConstraintMatchTotal` and `Indictment` classes have been converted into interfaces and in the process, their implementations were moved out of the public API, together with methods that allowed to mutate their state.
These methods were never intended for public API, and therefore there is no replacement for them.

You may still need the instances themselves if you choose to implement `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator`:

[source,java]
----
ConstraintMatchTotal maximumCapacityMatchTotal = new ConstraintMatchTotal(...);
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
ConstraintMatchTotal maximumCapacityMatchTotal = new DefaultConstraintMatchTotal(...);
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `ScoreManager`: generic type `Score` added

The `ScoreManager` and `ScoreExplanation` APIs
now have a generic type `Score` to avoid downcasts in your code, for example from `Score` to `HardSoftScore`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    @Inject // or @Autowired
    ScoreManager<TimeTable> scoreManager;
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    @Inject // or @Autowired
    ScoreManager<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> scoreManager;
----

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    HardSoftScore score = (HardSoftScore) explanation.getScore();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    HardSoftScore score = explanation.getScore();
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major]
=== `ConstraintMatchTotal`, `ConstraintMatch` and `Indictment`: generic type `Score` added

Just like `ScoreManager` and `ScoreExplanation`, the `ConstraintMatchTotal`, `ConstraintMatch` and `Indictment` APIs
now have a generic type `Score` to avoid downcasts in your code, for example from `Score` to `HardSoftScore`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    Map<String, ConstraintMatchTotal> constraintMatchTotalMap = scoreExplanation.getConstraintMatchTotalMap();
    ConstraintMatchTotal constraintMatchTotal = constraintMatchTotalMap.get(contraintId);
    HardSoftScore totalScore = (HardSoftScore) constraintMatchTotal.getScore();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    Map<String, ConstraintMatchTotal<HardSoftScore>> constraintMatchTotalMap = scoreExplanation.getConstraintMatchTotalMap();
    ConstraintMatchTotal<HardSoftScore> constraintMatchTotal = constraintMatchTotalMap.get(contraintId);
    HardSoftScore totalScore = constraintMatchTotal.getScore();
----

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    Map<Object, Indictment> indictmentMap = scoreExplanation.getIndictmentMap();
    Indictment indictment = indictmentMap.get(lesson);
    HardSoftScore totalScore = (HardSoftScore) indictment.getScore();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    Map<Object, Indictment<HardSoftScore>> indictmentMap = scoreExplanation.getIndictmentMap();
    Indictment<HardSoftScore> indictment = indictmentMap.get(lesson);
    HardSoftScore totalScore = indictment.getScore();
----


[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator`: generic type `Score` added

The interface `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator`
now also has a generic type parameter for `Score` to avoid raw type usages of `ConstraintMatchTotal` and `Indictment`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class MachineReassignmentIncrementalScoreCalculator
        implements ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator<MachineReassignment> {

    @Override
    public Collection<ConstraintMatchTotal> getConstraintMatchTotals() {
        ...
    }


    @Override
    public Map<Object, Indictment> getIndictmentMap() {
        ...
    }

}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class MachineReassignmentIncrementalScoreCalculator
        implements ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator<MachineReassignment, HardSoftLongScore> {

    @Override
    public Collection<ConstraintMatchTotal<HardSoftLongScore>> getConstraintMatchTotals() {
        ...
    }


    @Override
    public Map<Object, Indictment<HardSoftLongScore>> getIndictmentMap() {
        ...
    }

}
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== `AbstractCustomPhaseCommand` was removed

The abstract class `AbstractCustomPhaseCommand` was removed.
Any class that extends it should directly implement the `CustomPhaseCommand` interface.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class DinnerPartySolutionInitializer extends AbstractCustomPhaseCommand<DinnerParty> {

    @Override
    public void changeWorkingSolution(ScoreDirector<DinnerParty> scoreDirector) {
        ...
    }

}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class DinnerPartySolutionInitializer implements CustomPhaseCommand<DinnerParty> {

    @Override
    public void changeWorkingSolution(ScoreDirector<DinnerParty> scoreDirector) {
        ...
    }

}
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major]
=== Score calculators become public API

The interfaces `EasyScoreCalculator`, `IncrementalScoreCalculator` and `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator`
have moved to a new package in the public API.
Their deprecated counterparts have been removed.
The deprecated class `org.optaplanner.core.impl.score.director.incremental.AbstractIncrementalScoreCalculator`
has also been removed.
Replace the use of the removed interfaces and classes with their counterparts in the public API.

Before in `*EasyScoreCalculator.java`:

[source,java]
----
  ...

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `PlannerBenchmarkFactory`: `createFromSolverFactory()` removed

The method `PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverFactory()` has long been deprecated in favor of
`PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverConfigXmlResource(String)`.
It has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<CloudBalance> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml");
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverFactory(solverFactory);
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverConfigXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml");
----

If you programmatically adjust the solver configuration, you can use `PlannerBenchmarkConfig.createFromSolverConfig(SolverConfig)`
and then `PlannerBenchmarkFactory.create(PlannerBenchmarkConfig)` instead.

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `PlannerBenchmarkFactory`: `getPlannerBenchmarkConfig()` removed

The method `PlannerBenchmarkFactory.getPlannerBenchmarkConfig()` has long been deprecated in favor of
`PlannerBenchmarkFactory.create(PlannerBenchmarkConfig)`.
A `PlannerBenchmarkConfig` is now instantiated before a `PlannerBenchmarkFactory` is instantiated, which is more natural.
`PlannerBenchmarkFactory.getPlannerBenchmarkConfig()` has been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingBenchmarkConfig.xml");
PlannerBenchmarkConfig benchmarkConfig = benchmarkFactory.getPlannerBenchmarkConfig();
...
PlannerBenchmark benchmark = benchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark();

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== XML <plannerBenchmark/> root element now belongs to the https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/benchmark namespace
OptaPlanner now provides an XML Schema Definition for the benchmark configuration.
Although OptaPlanner keeps backward compatibility of the existing XML configuration,
migrating to the XSD is strongly recommended as OptaPlanner may support only valid configuration XML in the future.

Before in `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<plannerBenchmark>
  ...
</plannerBenchmark>
----

After in `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

----

Using the XSD may require reordering some of the XML elements of the configuration.
Use code completion in the IDE to migrate to a valid XML.

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `ProblemBenchmarksConfig`: `xStreamAnnotatedClass` removed

The `<xStreamAnnotatedClass/>` has been removed from the `<problemBenchmarks/>` configuration together with  the corresponding
`getXStreamAnnotatedClassList()` and `setXStreamAnnotatedClassList()` methods in the `ProblemBenchmarksConfig` class.

Before in `*.java`:

=== `BenchmarkAggregatorFrame`: `createAndDisplay(PlannerBenchmarkFactory)` removed

The method `BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplay(PlannerBenchmarkFactory)` has long been deprecated in favor of `BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplayFromXmlResource(String)`.
It has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromXmlResource(

----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplayFromXmlResource(

----

If you programmatically adjust the benchmark configuration, you can use `BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplay(PlannerBenchmarkConfig)` instead.

[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== Removed JavaScript expression support in configuration

Various elements of both the solver configuration and benchmark configuration no longer support nested
JavaScript expressions.
Users need to replace these with either auto-configuration or with integer constants.

=== Removed the deprecated variable listeners

A deprecated interface `VariableListener` from package `org.optaplanner.core.impl.domain.variable.listener` has been removed,
along with a deprecated interface `StatefulVariableListener`
and a deprecated class `VariableListenerAdapter` in that same package.
Instead, use an interface `VariableListener` from package `org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.variable`.

Before in `*VariableListener.java`:

== From 8.2.0.Final to 8.3.0.Final

[.upgrade-recipe-impl-detail]
=== `ConstraintMatch.compareTo()` inconsistent with `equals()`

The `equals()` override in `ConstraintMatch` has been removed.
As a result, two different `ConstraintMatch` instances are never considered equal.
This is in contrast to the `compareTo()` method, which continues to consider two instances equal
if all their field values are equal.

The `equals()` override in `ConstraintMatch` has been removed
in order to not fail on constraints with non-distinct matches.

== From 8.5.0.Final to 8.6.0.Final

[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== `@PlanningId` can no longer return null

If a field (or getter) annotated with a `@PlanningId` annotation returns a `null` value,
the `Solver` now fails fast immediately, instead of failing fast when the second instance with `null` value appears.

== From 8.7.0.Final to 8.8.0.Final

[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== `PlannerBenchmark.benchmark()` now returns `java.util.File`

The return type of `org.optaplanner.benchmark.api.PlannerBenchmark` methods `benchmark()` and `benchmarkAndShowReportInBrowser()`
has changed from `void` to `File`.
Users can read this value to retrieve the directory in which the benchmark results were written.

[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== `ConstraintCollectors.toSortedSet(BiFunction)` newly ambiguous

The addition of `ConstraintCollectors.toSortedSet(Comparator)` has caused a Java compiler ambiguity
with the pre-existing method `ConstraintCollectors.toSortedSet(BiFunction)`.
Users of the original method need to inform the compiler of the particular overload they wish to use.

Before in `*ConstraintProvider.java`:

[source,java]

  ...

  ConstraintCollectors.toSortedSet(Integer::sum);

=== Switch to Quarkus 2

OptaPlanner has been realigned with recently released Quarkus 2.0.
Users of the OptaPlanner Quarkus integration should refer to https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-2.0[Quarkus 2.0 migration guide].

Consequently, OptaPlanner binaries now require JDK 11 or higher to run.
Even though OptaPlanner 8.x has always required JDK 11, this only becomes a hard requirement with OptaPlanner 8.10.0.Final.

== From 8.11.0.Final to 8.12.0.Final

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-automated]
=== Rename optaplanner.solver.solve-length to optaplanner.solver.solve.duration

The Micrometer meter `optaplanner.solver.solve-length` has been renamed to `optaplanner.solver.solve.duration` to follow Micrometer naming conventions and make it appear better in a variety of monitoring systems. References to `optaplanner.solver.solve-length.+++*+++` in the monitoring system should be changed to `optaplanner.solver.solve.duration.+++*+++`.

== From 8.13.0.Final to 8.14.0.Final

[.upgrade-recipe-major]
=== Constraint Streams: use `forEach(...)` instead of `from(...)`

We have deprecated the following methods on the `ConstraintFactory` interface:

* `from(...)` in favor of `forEach(...)`,
* `fromUnfiltered(...)` in favor of `forEachIncludingNullVars(...)`,
* `fromUniquePair(...)` in favor of `forEachUniquePair(...)`.

The new methods behave differently when it comes to `nullable=true` planning variables.
The deprecated methods will eventually be removed in a future major version.

====  Impact on users without nullable planning variables

If you do not use over-constrained planning (where `@PlanningVariable(..., nullable = false)`) simply replace all the uses of the `from*` methods with `forEach*` methods.

Before in `*ConstraintProvider.java`:

[source,java]
----
    Constraint roomConflict(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.from(Lesson.class)
            ...
    }
----

After in `*ConstraintProvider.java`:

[source,java]
----
    Constraint roomConflict(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.forEach(Lesson.class)
            ...
    }
----

====  Impact on users with nullable planning variables

If you use over-constrained planning (where `@PlanningVariable(..., nullable = true)`) take into account the following:

* `forEach(...)` filters out planning entities with `null` values in any of their genuine planning variables,
regardless if they are initialized or not.
* The same applies for `join(...)` following a `forEach(...)`.
* And the same also applies for conditional propagation (`ifExists(...)`, `ifNotExists(...)` etc.) following a `forEach(...)`.

In practice, what this means is:

* Where you previously used `null` checks to exclude entities with unassigned variables,
you should remove these null checks after replacing `from(...)` with `forEach(...)`.

Before in `*ConstraintProvider.java`:

[source,java]
----
    Constraint departmentSpecialismConstraint(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.from(BedDesignation.class)
                .filter(bd -> bd.getBed() != null)
                ...
    }
----

After in `*ConstraintProvider.java`:

[source,java]
----
    Constraint departmentSpecialismConstraint(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.forEach(BedDesignation.class)
                ...
    }
----


* Where you deliberately intend to retrieve entities with `null` variables,
for example in the medium constraint to penalize all unassigned entities,
you must replace `from(...)` with `forEachIncludingNullVars(...)`.

Before in `*ConstraintProvider.java`:

[source,java]
----
    Constraint assignEveryPatientToABedConstraint(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.from(BedDesignation.class)
                .filter(bd -> bd.getBed() == null)
                .penalize("assignEveryPatientToABed", HardMediumSoftScore.ONE_MEDIUM,

=== `SolverManager.addProblemChange()` and `SolverJob.addProblemChange()` now return `CompletableFuture<Void>`

`SolverManager.addProblemChange()` and `SolverJob.addProblemChange()` return type has changed from `void`

[.upgrade-recipe-major]
=== Score DRL deprecated in favor of Constraint Streams

Support for Score DRL has been deprecated and users are encouraged to migrate to https://www.optaplanner.org/docs/optaplanner/latest/constraint-streams/constraint-streams.html[Constraint Streams] at their earliest convenience.
To help with migration, here's the link:drl-to-constraint-streams-migration.html[score DRL migration guide].
Score DRL is not going away in OptaPlanner 8.

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-automated]
=== Constraint Streams: pre-existing `penalize(...)`, `reward(...)` and `impact(...)` replaced with builders

Pre-existing methods to penalize and reward matches have been deprecated and will be removed in a future major version of OptaPlanner.
The newly introduced overloads follow the builder pattern instead.

Before in `*ConstraintProvider.java`:

[source,java]

                HardMediumSoftScore.ONE_MEDIUM,
                BedDesignation::getAdmissionPartNightCount);
    }
----

After in `*ConstraintProvider.java`:

[source,java]
----
   Constraint assignEveryPatientToABedConstraint(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
        return constraintFactory.forEach(BedDesignation.class)
            ...
            .penalize(HardMediumSoftScore.ONE_MEDIUM,
                BedDesignation::getAdmissionPartNightCount)
            .asConstraint("assignEveryPatientToABed");
    }
----

This change affects all pre-existing overloads of the various `penalize(...)`, `reward(...)` and `impact(...)` methods, including their `configurable` variants.
Javadocs on the deprecated methods include recommendations on which of the new overloads to switch to.

=== Justifications and indictments refactored

Score explanation subsystem has been refactored and expanded.
As a result, `ConstraintMatch.getJustificationList()` method is now deprecated and replaced by `ConstraintMatch.getJustification()`.
This method no longer returns a collection of objects.
Instead, it returns a `ConstraintJustification`-typed object that can be queried for the collection.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    List<Object> justificationList = constraintMatch.getJustificationList();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
   DefaultConstraintJustification justification = constraintMatch.getJustification();
   List<Object> facts = justification.getFacts();
----

Likewise, `Indictment.getJustification()` method has been deprecated in favor of the newly introduced `Indictment.getIndictedObject()` method.
The behavior is unchanged, this is a change in name only.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    Object justification = indictment.getJustification();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
   Object indictedObject = indictment.getIndictedObject();
----

For more information about these changes, refer to https://www.optaplanner.org/docs/optaplanner/latest/score-calculation/score-calculation.html#explainingTheScore[Explaining the score] in https://www.optaplanner.org/docs/[OptaPlanner documentation].

=== New custom shadow variable annotations

`@CustomShadowVariable` is now deprecated and superseded by `@ShadowVariable` and `@PiggybackShadowVariable`.

`@ShadowVariable` allows to declare 1 variable listener per source variable.
Use 1 `@ShadowVariable` annotation for each source variable.
You may reuse the same variable listener class for multiple sources or use a specialized listener for each source.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningEntity
public class RockShow implements RockStandstill {

    @PlanningVariable(...) private RockStandstill previousStandstill;
    @AnchorShadowVariable(...) private RockBus bus;

    ...

    @CustomShadowVariable(
            variableListenerClass = RockShowVariableListener.class,
            sources = {
                    @PlanningVariableReference(variableName = "previousStandstill"),
                    @PlanningVariableReference(variableName = "bus") })
    private LocalDate date;

    ...
}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningEntity
public class RockShow implements RockStandstill {

    @PlanningVariable(...) private RockStandstill previousStandstill;
    @AnchorShadowVariable(...) private RockBus bus;

    ...

    @ShadowVariable(
            variableListenerClass = RockShowVariableListener.class,
            sourceVariableName = "previousStandstill")
    @ShadowVariable(
            variableListenerClass = RockShowVariableListener.class,
            sourceVariableName = "bus")
    private LocalDate date;

    ...
}
----

Use `@PiggybackShadowVariable` to declare a shadow variable that does not have its own variable listener but is updated by another shadow variable's listener.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningEntity
public class RockShow implements RockStandstill {

    ...

    @CustomShadowVariable(variableListenerClass = RockShowVariableListener.class, sources = {...})
    private LocalDate date;

    @CustomShadowVariable(variableListenerRef = @PlanningVariableReference(variableName = "date"))
    private RockTimeOfDay timeOfDay;

    ...
}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningEntity
public class RockShow implements RockStandstill {

    ...

    @ShadowVariable(
            variableListenerClass = RockShowVariableListener.class,
            sourceVariableName = "previousStandstill")
    @ShadowVariable(
            variableListenerClass = RockShowVariableListener.class,
            sourceVariableName = "bus")
    private LocalDate date;

    @PiggybackShadowVariable(shadowVariableName = "date")
    private RockTimeOfDay timeOfDay;

    ...
}
----

=== XStream support deprecated

OptaPlanner's support for serializing planning solution using XStream has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release.
This includes the `optaplanner-persistence-xstream` Maven module and its content.

To continue serializing to XML, use `optaplanner-persistence-jaxb` instead.
Alternatively, switch to `optaplanner-persistence-jackson` to serialize into JSON.
OptaPlanner Examples have done just that.

* For a showcase of serializing a simple domain into JSON, see the `cloudbalancing` example.
* For a showcase of serializing a chained domain incl. polymorphic types into JSON, see the `tsp` example.
* For a showcase of serializing a domain based on planning list variable into JSON, see the `vehiclerouting` example.

OptaPlanner Quickstarts never used XStream, and are therefore not affected by these changes.

== From 8.33.0.Final to 8.34.0.Final

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-automated]
=== Various `Score` getters deprecated

Getters on `Score` and `BendableScore` implementations have been renamed
to match the new convention established by https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/language/records.html[Java records].
This means that the `get` prefix was dropped.
The original methods are deprecated for removal, but still available.

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
HardSoftScore score = ...;
int hardScore = score.getHardScore();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
HardSoftScore score = ...;
int hardScore = score.hardScore();
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== `AbstractScore` and `AbstractBendableScore` deprecated

In order to implement a custom score,
we now ask users to directly implement the `Score` or `IBendableScore` interfaces.
Their abstract implementations are now deprecated for removal and no longer used by the solver.

Before in `*Score.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class MyScore extends AbstractScore<MyScore> {

    ...

}
----

After in `*Score.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class MyScore implements Score<MyScore> {

    ...

}
----

Before in `*BendableScore.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class MyBendableScore extends AbstractBendableScore<MyBendableScore> {

    ...

}
----

After in `*BendableScore.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class MyBendableScore implements IBendableScore<MyScore> {

    ...

}
----

Note that support for custom scores has long since been deprecated as well,
and this change should therefore not impact many users, if any.

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-automated]
=== `ScoreManager` renamed to `SolutionManager`

* Due to the expanding functional scope of the interface,
we decided to deprecate for removal the `ScoreManager` interface and bring a new one instead,
called `SolutionManager`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreManager<MySolution, Score> scoreManager = ScoreManager.create(...);
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    SolutionManager<MySolution, Score> solutionManager = SolutionManager.create(...);
----

* In the new interface,
`ScoreDirector` methods `updateScore(...)` and `explainScore(...)` methods
have been renamed to `update(...)` and `explain(...)` respectively.

[source,java]
----
    Score score = scoreManager.updateScore(mySolution);
    ScoreExplanation<MySolution, Score> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(mySolution);
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    Score score = solutionManager.update(mySolution);
    ScoreExplanation<MySolution, Score> explanation = solutionManager.explain(mySolution);
----

* Finally, the `getSummary(...)` method has been deprecated for removal.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    String summary = scoreManager.getSummary(mySolution);
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    String summary = solutionManager.explain(mySolution)
        .getSummary();
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major]
=== SubList size configuration on move selectors deprecated

We have introduced a new configuration class for the `SubListSelector` and moved the `minimumSubListSize` and `maximumSubListSize` configuration properties from `SubListChangeMoveSelectorConfig` and from `SubListSwapMoveSelectorConfig` to `SubListSelectorConfig`.
The move selectors' subList size properties have been deprecated and will eventually be removed in a future major version.

Before in `*SolverConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<solver>
  ...
  <localSearch>
    <unionMoveSelector>
      <subListChangeMoveSelector>
        <minimumSubListSize>2</minimumSubListSize>
        <maximumSubListSize>4</maximumSubListSize>
        <selectReversingMoveToo>true</selectReversingMoveToo>
      </subListChangeMoveSelector>
      <subListSwapMoveSelector>
        <minimumSubListSize>2</minimumSubListSize>
        <maximumSubListSize>4</maximumSubListSize>
        <selectReversingMoveToo>true</selectReversingMoveToo>
      </subListSwapMoveSelector>
    </unionMoveSelector>
    ...
  </localSearch>
</solver>

=== `AbstractHibernateScoreType` and its subtypes deprecated

The `AbstractScoreHibernateType` as well as all its subtypes have been deprecated. The parallel OptaPlanner 9
releases are going to introduce Hibernate 6, which unfortunately breaks backward compatibility
of the `CompositeUserType` that the `AbstractScoreHibernateType` depends on.

The `AbstractScoreHibernateType` and its subtypes remain available in the OptaPlanner 8 releases to provide
integration with Hibernate 5 but will be removed in OptaPlanner 9.

To integrate the `PlanningScore` of your choice with Hibernate 6, either use the score converters available in the
`org.optaplanner.persistence.jpa.api.score.buildin` package or https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/current/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#embeddable-mapping-custom[implement the `CompositeUserType`] on your own.

The following example shows how to replace the `HardSoftScoreHibernateType` with the `HardSoftScoreConverter`.
Be aware that the persisted data formats of these two approaches are not compatible.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningSolution
@Entity
@TypeDef(defaultForType = HardSoftScore.class, typeClass = HardSoftScoreHibernateType.class)
public class CloudBalance {

    @PlanningScore
    @Columns(columns = {@Column(name = "initScore"), @Column(name = "hardScore"), @Column(name = "softScore")})
    protected HardSoftScore score;

    ...
}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
@PlanningSolution
@Entity
public class CloudBalance {

    @PlanningScore
    @Convert(converter = HardSoftScoreConverter.class)
    protected HardSoftScore score;

    ...
}
----
