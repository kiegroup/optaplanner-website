Java 17 (released yesterday) comes with many new features and enhancements.
However, most of those require code changes to benefit from.
_Except for performance._
Simply switch your JDK installation and you get a free performance boost.
But how much? Is it worth it?
Let's find out by comparing the benchmarks of JDK 17, JDK 16 and JDK 11.

== Benchmark methodology

* Hardware: A stable machine without any other computational demanding processes running and with
`Intel® Xeon® Silver 4116 @ 2.1 GHz (12 cores total / 24 threads)` and `128 GiB` RAM memory, running `RHEL 8 x86_64`.

* JDKs (used to both compile and run):

** JDK 11
+
----
openjdk 11.0.12 2021-07-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-11.0.12+7 (build 11.0.12+7)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-11.0.12+7 (build 11.0.12+7, mixed mode)
----

** JDK 16
+
----
openjdk 16.0.2 2021-07-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 16.0.2+7-67)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.0.2+7-67, mixed mode, sharing)
----

** JDK 17 (downloaded 2021-09-06)
+
----
openjdk 17 2021-09-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17+35-2724)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17+35-2724, mixed mode, sharing)
----

* JVM options: `-Xmx3840M` and explicitly specify a garbage collector:

** `-XX:+UseG1GC` for G1GC, the low latency garbage collector (the default in all three JDKs).

** `-XX:+UseParallelGC` for ParallelGC, the high throughput garbage collector.

* Main class: `org.optaplanner.examples.app.GeneralOptaPlannerBenchmarkApp`
from the module `optaplanner-examples` in OptaPlanner `8.10.0.Final`.

** Each run solves 11 planning problems with OptaPlanner, such as
https://www.optaplanner.org/learn/useCases/employeeRostering.html[employee rostering],
https://www.optaplanner.org/learn/useCases/schoolTimetabling.html[school timetabling] and
https://www.optaplanner.org/learn/useCases/cloudOptimization.html[cloud optimization].
Each planning problem runs for 5 minutes. Logging is set to `INFO`.
The benchmark starts with a 30 second JVM warm up which is discarded.

** Solving a planning problem involves *no IO* (except a few milliseconds during startup to load the input). *A single
CPU is completely saturated.* It constantly creates many short-lived objects, and the GC collects them afterwards.

** The benchmarks measure the number of scores calculated per second. Higher is better. Calculating
a score for a proposed planning solution is non-trivial: it involves many calculations, including checking for
conflicts between every entity and every other entity.

* Runs: Each JDK and each garbage collector combination is run 3 times sequentially.
The results below is the average of those 3 runs.

[NOTE]
====
Looking at the raw data of the 3 individual runs (not shown here),
the Machine Reassignment numbers (B1 and B10) fluctuate a lot between runs on the same JDK and GC.
Often by more than 10%. The other numbers don't suffer from this unreliability.

_It's arguably better to ignore the Machine Reassignment numbers_.
But to avoid cherry-picking data concerns, these results and averages do include them.

== Executive summary

On average, for OptaPlanner use cases, these benchmarks indicate that:

* *Java 17 is 8.66% faster than Java 11* and 2.41% faster than Java 16 for G1GC (default).

* Java 17 is 6.54% faster than Java 11 and 0.37% faster than Java 16 for ParallelGC.

* The Parallel Garbage Collector is 16.39% faster than the G1 Garbage Collector.

No big surprises here: the latest JDK is faster
and the high throughput garbage collector is faster than the low latency garbage collector.

== Wait a minute here...

When https://www.optaplanner.org/blog/2021/01/26/HowMuchFasterIsJava15.html[we benchmarked JDK 15],
we saw that Java 15 was 11.24% faster than Java 11. Now, the gain of Java 17 over Java 11 is less.
Does that mean that Java 17 is slower than Java 15?

Well, no. _Java 17 is faster than Java 15 too._
Those previous benchmarks were run on a different codebase (OptaPlanner 7.44 instead of 8.10).
Don't compare apples and oranges.

== Conclusion

In conclusion, the performance gained in the JDK17 version is well worth the upgrade - at least for https://www.optaplanner.org/[OptaPlanner] use cases.

In addition, the fastest garbage collector for these use cases is still `ParallelGC`, instead of `G1GC` (the default).
