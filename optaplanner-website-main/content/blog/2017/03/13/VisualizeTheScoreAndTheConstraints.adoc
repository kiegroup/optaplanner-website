So we solved the planning problem and found a best solution which has a score of `0hard/-123soft`.
Why `-123soft`? Where does that penalty come from? Which constraints are broken?
Let's see how we can break down the score and visualize the pain points in a UI.

Let's approach this problem from two sides on the course scheduling example:

== Break down score per constraint type

In the top-down approach, we split up the score per constraint type (so per score rule):

|===
|Constraint type |Score impact

|Room capacity >|`-100soft`
|Room stability >|`-40soft`
|Curriculum compactness >|`-3soft`
h|Total >h|`-123soft`
|===

The _room capacity_ constraint is broken the most: it causes for `81%` (`100/123`) of the score loss.
Maybe the school should invest in more classrooms?

== Heat map with score impact per planning entity

In the bottom-up approach, we visualize the score impact per lecture:

* Red lectures impact hard constraints.
* Orange lectures impact only soft constraints. The higher the impact, the heavier the color.
* White lectures don't impact the score.

|===

|Near optimal a|image::courseScheduling2NearOptimal.png[link="courseScheduling2NearOptimal.png" role="thumbnail"] a|image::courseScheduling2IndictmentNearOptimal.png[link="courseScheduling2IndictmentNearOptimal.png" role="thumbnail"] |`0hard/-1soft` (*)
|Optimal a|image::courseScheduling3Optimal.png[link="courseScheduling3Optimal.png" role="thumbnail"] a|image::courseScheduling3IndictmentOptimal.png[link="courseScheduling3IndictmentOptimal.png" role="thumbnail"] |`0hard/0soft`
|===

As OptaPlanner finds better and better solutions, there is less and less orange on the heat map.
Looks like the _history_ courses are particularly hard to schedule.
Maybe the school should look for an additional history teacher?

(*) Notice that `-1soft` is shared by multiple lectures:
3 lectures break the _room stability_ constraint together
because two of them use a different room than the other one.

== Show me the API

OptaPlanner 7 provides this information out of the box through the ConstraintMatch API:

image::scoreVisualization.png[]

First build a `ScoreDirector` with `Solver.getScoreDirectorFactory()` and then:

* Break down the score per constraint type with `ScoreDirector.getConstraintMatchTotals()`.
  Each `ConstraintMatchTotal` represents one score rule and has its total score.
* Determine the score impact per planning entity with `ScoreDirector.getIndictmentMap()`.
  Each `Indictment` holds the total score impact of one planning entity.
  Use that score to create the heat map in your UI.

== Try it out

. https://www.optaplanner.org/download/download.html[Download OptaPlanner] `7.0.0.CR1` or higher.
. Run an example and load a dataset.
. Click on the image:indictmentHeatMapTrueIcon.png[flame] button at the bottom left.
. Click the solve button.

== Conclusion

Help the user make sense of the resulting score.
Visualize which constraints and planning entities cause most harm.
