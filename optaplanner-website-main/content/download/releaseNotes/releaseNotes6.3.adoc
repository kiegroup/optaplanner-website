[[NewAndNoteWorthy]]
== New and noteworthy

=== Easier solver configuration

Defining the optimization algorithms and their parameters is now optional (but still possible and desirable for power users).
If you don't define any solver phases, a default Construction Heuristic followed by a default Local Search is used.

[source,xml]
----
<solver>
  ...
  <scoreDirectorFactory>
    ...
  </scoreDirectorFactory>

  <!-- No longer required to configure <constructionHeuristic> and <localSearch> -->
</solver>
----

=== Automatic scanning for annotated classes

Instead of declaring all annotated classes:

[source,xml]
----
<solver>
  <solutionClass>org.optaplanner.examples.cloudbalancing.domain.CloudBalance</solutionClass>
  <entityClass>org.optaplanner.examples.cloudbalancing.domain.CloudProcess</entityClass>
  ...
</solver>
----

Planner can now also automatically scan for them instead:

[source,xml]
----
<solver>
  <scanAnnotatedClasses/>
  ...
</solver>
----

It's even possible to limit the scan to specific packages.

=== Field annotations

Instead of getter annotations (on JavaBean properties), Planner now also supports field annotations:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningEntity
public class CloudProcess {

    @PlanningVariable(valueRangeProviderRefs = {"computerRange"})
    private CloudComputer computer;

    ...
}
----

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance ... {

    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;

    @PlanningEntityCollectionProperty
    private List<CloudProcess> processList;

    ...
}
----

=== Unfolding move selectors for multiple entity classes or multiple planning variables

With multiple planning variables, it's no longer needed to specify each variable name:

[source,xml]
----
      <changeMoveSelector>
        <valueSelector>
          <variableName>period</variableName>
        </valueSelector>
      </changeMoveSelector>
      <changeMoveSelector>
        <valueSelector>
          <variableName>room</variableName>
        </valueSelector>
      </changeMoveSelector>
----

Instead, this now works:

[source,xml]
----
      <changeMoveSelector/>
----

With multiple entity classes, it's no longer needed to specify each entity class:

[source,xml]
----
      <changeMoveSelector>
        <entitySelector>
          <entityClass>...CoachEntity</entityClass>
        </entitySelector>
      </changeMoveSelector>
      <changeMoveSelector>
        <entitySelector>
          <entityClass>...ShuttleEntity</entityClass>
        </entitySelector>
      </changeMoveSelector>
      <swapMoveSelector>
        <entitySelector>
          <entityClass>...CoachEntity</entityClass>
        </entitySelector>
      </swapMoveSelector>
      <swapMoveSelector>
        <entitySelector>
          <entityClass>...ShuttleEntity</entityClass>
        </entitySelector>
      </swapMoveSelector>
----

Instead, this now works:

[source,xml]
----
      <changeMoveSelector/>
      <swapMoveSelector/>
----

This applies to the programmatic API too, of course.

=== VariableListeners now trigger in a smart order

In advanced use cases with multiple custom shadow variables (or even just one),
the immediate order in which a `VariableListener` was triggered could drive a developer insane
because (s)he had to deal with intermediate, inconsistent states for which not all of the genuine variables were already changed.

This has been fixed. OptaPlanner now triggers the `VariableListener.after*()` methods in the order defined by the shadow variable dependency graph.
It guarantees that the first VariableListener triggers _after_ the last genuine variable has changed.
It also guarantees that the second VariableListener triggers _after_ all the first VariableListener calls are done, and so on.

=== New Benchmarker bluePrints

There are 2 new benchmarker blueprints:

* EVERY_LOCAL_SEARCH_TYPE
* EVERY_CONSTRUCTION_HEURISTIC_TYPE_WITH_EVERY_LOCAL_SEARCH_TYPE

It's now even easier to try out all Local Search algorithms:

[source,xml]
----
<plannerBenchmark>
  <benchmarkDirectory>local/data/cloudbalancing</benchmarkDirectory>
  <inheritedSolverBenchmark>
    ...
  </inheritedSolverBenchmark>
  <solverBenchmarkBluePrint>
    <solverBenchmarkBluePrintType>EVERY_LOCAL_SEARCH_TYPE</solverBenchmarkBluePrintType>
  </solverBenchmarkBluePrint>
</plannerBenchmark>

=== New example: Investment asset class allocation

To optimize an investment portfolio. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdyIf0JG94Y[this video].
Partially contributed by Satish Irrinki.

=== Other improvements

* A bi-directional relationship with a planning variable is now also supported for a non-chained variable.
* 2 shadow variables can now share the same `VariableListener` instance.
* `ValueRangeProvider` now supports `long` ranges with `createLongValueRange(from, to)` too.
* `ValueRangeProvider` now supports `BigInteger` ranges with `createBigIntegerValueRange(from, to)` too.
* Improved `Move.toString()` methods for more clearer log messages.
* Benchmarker report mentions logging level used. Contributed by Matej Čimbora.
* Documentation for Android. Contributed by Tomáš David.
* Benchmarker's `<solverBenchmark>` name now allows non-ASCII characters too (for example Japanese characters).
* An OSGi `features.xml` that includes `optaplanner-engine`
* Drools score calculation now support multiple constraint matches in the consequences part of a rule.
* More JavaDocs, including package JavaDocs.
* Various bugs resolved. See https://issues.redhat.com/projects/PLANNER?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page&status=released[our issue tracker].
