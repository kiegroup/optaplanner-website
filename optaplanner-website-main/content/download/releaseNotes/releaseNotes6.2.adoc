=== Scalable VRP with nearby selection

Nearby selection allows a vehicle routing problem to scale out gracefully beyond 1000 locations,
without the need for partitioning.
It works by focusing on move selections that modify locations that are near each other:

It results in much better scalability on larger datasets, for example a VRP with 2750 customers
(higher is better), which reduces fuel and labor expenses by `15%` in a 5 minute run:

Several nearby selection probability distributions are supported:
block distribution, linear distribution, parabolic distribution and beta distribution.

=== TailChainSwapMove (2-opt) for VRP

TailChainSwapMove is a new move type for chained variables.
It's a subset of SubchainChangeMove and SubchainSwapMove, but it's generally more efficient,
especially for time windowed cases.

In our benchmarks, a union of ChangeMove, SwapMove and TailChainSwapMove (using nearby selection on all 3)
performed best.

=== Improved built-in variable listener efficiency

VRP with a `@InverseRelationShadowVariable` is now more efficient. In some cases, it's up to *`32%` faster*.

=== Strategic Oscillation Tabu Search

Strategic Oscillation Tabu Search is often an improvement over normal Tabu Search.
Instead of picking the accepted move with the highest score, it employs a different mechanism:
If there's an improving move, it picks it. If there's no improving move however,
it prefers moves which improve a softer score level, over moves which break a harder score level less.

To enable it, do this:

    </acceptor>

=== New example: Cheap time scheduling

Schedule all tasks in time and on a machine to minimize the power cost.
Each machine must have enough hardware to run all of its tasks.
Each task and machine consumes power. The power price differs over time.

=== New benchmarker statistics: Constraint Match Total Best/Step score

These new statistics visualize how the individual constraint types change over time.

This gives a better insight as to which constraints impact the score the most.

=== Other improvements

* Construction Heuristics: new pick early type: `FIRST_FEASIBLE_SCORE` which is useful for scaling.
* Benchmarker: logarithmic scale for Problem scale axis when appropriate. Contributed by Ondrej Skopek.
* BendableLongScore: Bendable score with long types. Contributed by Dieter De Paepe.
