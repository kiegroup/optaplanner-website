== New and noteworthy

=== Drools Planner renamed to OptaPlanner

OptaPlanner is the new name for Drools Planner.
For more information, see https://www.optaplanner.org/community/droolsPlannerRenamed.html[the full announcement].

=== Faster and easier scoreDRL

The new _constraint match_ system is:

* *Faster*: The average calculate count per seconds increases between 7% and 40% on average per use case.
* *Easier* to read and write
* *Less error-prone*: It's much harder to cause score corruption in your DRL.

Before:

[source,drl]
----
    rule "conflictingLecturesSameCourseInSamePeriod"
        when
            ...
        then
            insertLogical(new IntConstraintOccurrence("conflictingLecturesSameCourseInSamePeriod", ConstraintType.HARD,
                    -1,
                    $leftLecture, $rightLecture));
    end
----

After:

[source,drl]
----
    rule "conflictingLecturesSameCourseInSamePeriod"
        when
            ...
        then
            scoreHolder.addHardConstraintMatch(kcontext, -1);
    end
----

Notice that you don't need to repeat the rule name or the causes (the lectures) no more.
OptaPlanner figures out it itself through the `kcontext` variable.
Drools automatically exposes the `kcontext` variable in the RHS, so you don't need any extra code for it.

You also no longer need to hack the APIs to get a list of all ``ConstraintOccurrence``s:
the `ConstraintMatch` objects (and their totals per constraint) are available directly on the `ScoreDirector` API.

and link:../../learn/documentation.html[the reference manual].

=== Construction heuristics now use selectors

The construction heuristics now use the selector architecture so they support selection filtering, etc.
Sorting can be overwritten at a configuration level (very handy for benchmarking).

In use cases with multiple planning variables (for example period, room and teacher),
you can now switch to a far more scalable configuration.

=== Automatic solution cloning

Implementing the ``Solution``'s planning clone method is now optional.
This means there's less boilerplate code to write and it's harder to cause score corruption in your code.

and link:../../learn/documentation.html[the reference manual].

=== New built-in scores

There are new built-in score definitions, such as: `HardMediumSoftScore` (3 score levels),
`BendableScore` (configurable number of score levels), `HardSoftLongScore`, `HardSoftDoubleScore`,
`HardSoftBigDecimalScore`, ...

=== Planning Variable Listener (shadow variables)

A planning variable can now have a listener which updates a shadow planning variable.

A shadow planning variable is a variable that is never changed directly,
but can be calculated based on the state of the genuine planning variables.
For example: in VRP with time windows, the `arrivalTime` at a customer can be calculated
based on the previous customers of that vehicle.

=== Bi-directional variable relationship for chained variables

A shadow planning variable can now be `mappedBy` a genuine variable.
OptaPlanner will automatically update the shadow variable if the genuine variable is changed.
Currently this is only supported for chained variables.

=== TSP and VRP: Chained variables are more scalable

Several improvements have made use cases like TSP and VRP more scalable.
The code has been optimized to run significantly faster.
Also, `<subChainSelector>` now supports `<maximumSubChainSize>` to scale out better.

=== New metaheuristic: Step Counting Hill Climbing

_Step Counting Hill Climbing_ is easy to configure and has good results.
Generally, it behaves and feels a lot like _Late Acceptance_. Try it out with the Benchmarker.

=== Benchmarker improvements

* Best solution mutation statistic: shows for every new best solution found,
how many variables needed to change to improve the last best solution.
* Step score statistic: shows how the step score evolves over time.
* The Benchmarker now highlights infeasible solutions with an orange exclamation mark.
* The Benchmarker now shows standard deviation per solver configuration (thanks to Miroslav Svitok).

=== New examples

* VRP with time windows: The VRP example can now also handle the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows.
* Project job scheduling: A form of job shop scheduling, for example to schedule the production of diverse books, cars
or other products to machines and employees (thanks to Lukáš Petrovický)

=== Example improvements

* The GUI's of course scheduling, exam scheduling, hospital bed planning and sport scheduling have been improved.
* The optaplanner examples Swing GUI has been redesigned to take up less space.
* A webapp variant of the cloud balancing example has been added to `optaplanner-webexamples.war` (thanks to Frederic Hornain).

=== Other improvements

* Domain classes that extend/implement a `@PlanningEntity` class or interface can now be used as planning entities.
* Nullable variables support improved and fixed.
* _Late Acceptance_ improved.
* Ratio based entity tabu (thanks to Lukáš Petrovický).
* Drools properties can now be optionally specified in the solver configuration XML.
* Mimic selection: useful to create a cartesian product selection of 2 change move selectors
that move different variables of the same entity.
* `KieBase` support, for example to integrate decision tables or scorecards.
* OSGi support out-of-the-box in the optaplanner jars.
