== Why reproduce benchmarks?

_Never trust a benchmark report that you can't run locally._

Decision makers hold benchmark reports in high regard, because they represent an objective comparison.
However, it's common for benchmark creators to unknowingly distort a benchmark in favor of their own project,
even without malicious intent. To minimize this impact, a benchmark should be open and easily reproducible.

== How to reproduce our benchmarks

. Build `optaplanner-examples` link:../code/sourceCode.html[from source] or link:../download/download.html[from the distribution zip].
. Find the relevant `BenchmarkApp` class, for example
https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner/blob/main/optaplanner-examples/src/main/java/org/optaplanner/examples/cloudbalancing/optional/benchmark/CloudBalancingBenchmarkApp.java[`CloudBalancingBenchmarkApp.java`]
for cloud optimization.
. Run it with the VM Options `-Xmx2G -server`.
