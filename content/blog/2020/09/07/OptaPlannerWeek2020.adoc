It's a wrap! Last week, during the online *OptaPlanner Week* event,
we had 10 talks by 13 speakers across 3 days with - per day -
up to 250+ live attendees and 1300+ viewers afterwards.
We've split up the talks into separate videos for your convenience, watch them below.

Big thanks to all speakers for their superb content,
all attendees for their great questions
and especially Karina Varela for organizing, hosting and moderating this event perfectly.

There was a lot of interaction with the audience
through live questions during the sessions and a very active YouTube chat.
Some reactions on Twitter:

* _Learnt so much @optaplanner at the #optaplannerweek looking forward to next year's already :) cracking virtual event! Kudos to everyone that made it happen._
