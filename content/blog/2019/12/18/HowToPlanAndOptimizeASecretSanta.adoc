Many workplaces host a "Secret Santa", where each employee gets assigned
a coworker whom they need to buy a present for. This fosters good relations
between the employees and brings them closer together. But what about global
companies, where coworkers may be many miles apart? Ideally, we want
employees who are further apart to give gifts to each other, since they
are the ones who probably know the least about each other. Let's optimize
it with OptaPlanner!

== The Constraints

One of the most obvious constraints is that everyone should get a gift.
Or phrased a little differently: no one should get multiple gifts.

Here is how one would create this constraint in OptaPlanner using the
constraint streams API:
[source,java]
----
private Constraint sameReceiverConflict(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
    return constraintFactory
            .fromUniquePair(SecretSantaAssignment.class,
                    Joiners.equal(SecretSantaAssignment::getReceiver))
            .penalize("Same Receiver", HardMediumSoftBigDecimalScore.ONE_HARD);
}
----

Next, we need to reward assignments where the gifter and the receiver
are farther apart. Here's how we do it with constraint streams:
[source,java]
----
private Constraint largerDistanceAward(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
    return constraintFactory
            .from(SecretSantaAssignment.class)
            .rewardConfigurableBigDecimal("secretFactor", "Larger Distance Award",
                              (m) -> BigDecimal.valueOf(Location.calculateDistanceBetween(m.getGifter().getLocation(),
                                                                       m.getReceiver().getLocation())));
}
----

Let's try solving with just these two constraints to see what we get:

Alice is assigned to Daniella, Daniella is assigned to Alice...
Bob is assigned to Austin, Austin is assigned to Bob...
Something about this solution seems odd; it only has assignments
where the gifter is the receiver's recipient!

== What happened?

This is not odd at all, but rather a consequence of how we defined
our constraints: if Alice is the person furthest from Daniella, then
Daniella is most likely the person furthest from Alice. This means our
"Larger Distance Award" constraint will strongly favor pairs of employees.

Is this a bad thing? Yes, it is: imagine if Alice got a $100 gift from
Daniella, but only got Daniella a $10 gift. Alice will probably feel bad,
and Daniella will feel disappointed. If Alice gave the $10 gift to Bob
and Bob gave a $30 gift to Daniella, Alice wouldn't feel bad and
Daniella wouldn't feel cheated.

Let's add this constraint (using, you guessed it, constraint streams!)
[source,java]
----
private Constraint giftPair(ConstraintFactory constraintFactory) {
    return constraintFactory
            .fromUniquePair(SecretSantaAssignment.class,
            // Here, we are joining (a,b) where:
            // a.gifter = b.receiver
            // and
            // a.receiver = b.gifter
            // In other words: a's gifter is getting a gift from b's gifter
            // and b's gifter is getting a gift from a's gifter, which mean
            // we have a pair!
                            Joiners.equal(SecretSantaAssignment::getGifter, SecretSantaAssignment::getReceiver),
                            Joiners.equal(SecretSantaAssignment::getReciever, SecretSantaAssignment::getGifter))
            .penalize("Gifter-Receiver Cycle", HardMediumSoftBigDecimalScore.ONE_MEDIUM);
}
----
This constraint should be a medium constraint - we want to avoid it if possible,
but it isn't as much of a dealbreaker as someone not receiving a gift.

Now let's try solving again after adding the gift pair constraint:

image::withPairChecking.png[]

Much better; we end up with two chains: Alice gives to Austin who gives
to Bob who gives to Charlie who gives to Alice; and Dina gives to
Dennis who gives to Daniella who gives to Julian who gives to Dina.

This is just the beginning of what you can do to optimize Secret Santa using
OptaPlanner. For instance, you can do the following:

- Allow each person to input a list of people who they do not want to be
Secret Santa for, and add a medium constraint that ensures they are not
the Secret Santa for anyone in their list (if possible).

- Use a secret factor that sightly influences distance so people cannot
find out who their Secret Santa is just by running OptaPlanner.

- Pin a Secret Santa assignment to force OptaPlanner to use that assignment
in its solution.
