https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-wb-es-docs/html_single/#_ch.kie.server[KIE Server]
is a standalone server component that can be used to instantiate and execute rules and processes.
In this blog, you will learn how to build an OptaPlanner service that implements continuous and real-time planning to solve the
Task Assignment problem and deploy it to the KIE Server.


== https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-server-optaplanner-task-assignment[Task Assignment KJAR]

https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/03/14/what-is-a-kjar/[KJAR] or "Knowledge JAR" is a standard JAR file that has
some extra files included (at least a `META-INF/kmodule.xml` file). You will build Task Assignment Service as a KJAR.

NOTE: In order to build the KJAR, the project's pom.xml needs to have a `<packaging>kjar</packaging>` entry and contains
`kie-maven-plugin`.

=== Problem Description

Assign each task to a spot in an employee’s queue. Each task has a duration which is affected by the employee’s affinity
level with the task’s customer.

Constraints:

- [Hard] Skill: Each task requires one or more skill. The employee must possess all these skills.
- [Soft 0] Critical tasks: Complete critical tasks first, sooner than major and minor tasks.
- [Soft 1] Minimize makespan: Reduce the time to complete all tasks.
- [Soft 2] Major tasks: Complete major tasks as soon as possible, sooner than minor tasks.
- [Soft 3] Minor tasks: Complete minor tasks as soon as possible.

=== https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#realTimePlanning[Real-time Planning]

As new tasks come in and others start being implemented, the optimal solution might change. OptaPlanner handles such scenarios using
https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#problemFactChange[ProblemFactChange].

For example, if an employee starts working on a task, tell OptaPlanner to https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/#pinDownPlanningEntities[pin] this task by sending a `PinTaskProblemFactChange`.
Each `ProblemFactChange` type is implemented as a class that implements the interface `ProblemFactChange<Solution_>`.
In the Task Assignment example, this class can be something like:

[source,java]
----
public class PinTaskProblemFactChange implements ProblemFactChange<TaskAssigningSolution> {
    ...

    @Override
    public void doChange(ScoreDirector<TaskAssigningSolution> scoreDirector) {
        ...
        scoreDirector.beforeProblemPropertyChanged(toBePinnedTask);
        toBePinnedTask.setPinned(true);
        scoreDirector.afterProblemPropertyChanged(toBePinnedTask);
        ...

        scoreDirector.triggerVariableListeners();
    }
}
----

The full class can be found https://github.com/kiegroup/kie-server-optaplanner-task-assignment/blob/master/task-assignment-kjar/src/main/java/org/kie/server/examples/optaplanner/taskassignment/kjar/domain/realtime/PinTaskProblemFactChange.java[on GitHub].

=== https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#solverConfiguration[Solver Configuration]

The solver configuration file determines how the solving process works. For a KJAR deployed to a KIE Server and since we are using
Drools for score calculation, use a `ksessionName`. This tells the KieContainer where to find the DRL file.
Add an optataskKsession to `META-INF/kmodule.xml` file:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<kbase name="optataskKBase" packages="PATH_TO_SOLVER_RESOURCES">
    <ksession name="optataskKsession"/>
</kbase>
----

And to solver config file:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<scoreDirectorFactory>
    <ksessionName>optataskKsession</ksessionName>
</scoreDirectorFactory>
----

Notice that both solver configuration and DRL files need to be in the `resources` folder under the path
`PATH_TO_SOLVER_RESOURCES`.

For real-time planning, set the solver in
https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#daemon[daemon mode] in order to resume
solving once a problem fact change is added. This is accomplished by adding the following to the solver config file:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<daemon>true</daemon>
----

=== Persistence

Since you will be sending and receiving data to/from KIE Server through REST API, you need to tell it how to marshall/unmarshall
this data. Read how OptaPlanner
https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#integrationWithXStream[marshals a score] using Xstream.

OptaPlanner stores all planning entities as objects and references to these objects, which might result in a lot of redundant data
received from the server. In our example, we are using
https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations/wiki/Jackson-Annotations#object-references-identity[@JsonIdentityInfo]
to avoid such redundancies.

=== Dependencies

The minimum required dependencies to build the OptaPlanner service are: optaplanner-core, optaplanner-persistence-xstream.

NOTE: Because you will be using several OptaPlanner modules, it’s recommended to import the optaplanner-bom
in Maven’s `dependencyManagement` so that OptaPlanner version is specified only once.


== Build and Deployment

Now that you have the KJAR ready, you can deploy it to the KIE Server and perform all planning operations.
You can send HTTP requests to the server using REST API.

=== Deployment

`POST /config`

Through the above endpoint, you can execute various commands on the KIE Server.

For example, to create a container running your OptaPlanner service, the request's body should be:

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
  commands: [
    {
      'create-container': {
        'container': {
          'container-id': CONTAINER_ID,
          'release-id': {
            'group-id': GROUP_ID,
            'artifact-id': ARTIFACT_ID,
            'version': VERSION,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
----

Notice that the GAV in the `release-id` object are your KJAR's GAV.

=== Solver registration

`PUT /containers/{CONTAINER_ID}/solvers/{SOLVER_ID}`

With body:

[source,json,options="nowrap"]
----
{
  'solver-config-file': 'PATH_TO_SOLVER_CONFIG_FILE.xml'
}
----

This will build a new solver from the xml resource included in the KJAR.

=== Submit a problem

`POST /containers/{CONTAINER_ID}/solvers/{SOLVER_ID}/state/solving`

Once a solver is built it will be waiting for a problem to start solving. The body of this request contains the object
annotated as `@PlanningSolution`, in the Task Assignment example it will be `TaskAssigningSolution`.

=== Query bestSolution

`GET /containers/{CONTAINER_ID}/solvers/{SOLVER_ID}/bestsolution`

This response body will contain `best-solution` object in addition to extra information about the solver status and score.

=== Submit a ProblemFactChange

`POST /containers/{CONTAINER_ID}/solvers/{SOLVER_ID}/problemfactchanges`

Submits a ProblemFactChange to update the problem the solver is solving. For example if you want to delete
a task the body should be:

//TODO: Update the example to JSON once figure out the required format
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<problem-fact-change class="TaDeleteTaskProblemFactChange">
    <taskId>TO_BE_DELETED_TASK_ID</taskId>
</problem-fact-change>
----

Notice the use of `class` attribute, this is how you tell OptaPlanner service what type of ProblemFactChange you are submitting.
Here `TaDeleteTaskProblemFactChange` is an `@XStreamAlias` for the `DeleteTaskProblemFactChange`.


NOTE: All the requests above have a base URL `http://SERVER:PORT/CONTEXT/services/rest/server` and require basic HTTP
Authentication for the role kie-server.

Check all the available endpoints https://docs.optaplanner.org/7.14.0.Final/optaplanner-wb-es-docs/html_single/#_optaplanner_rest_api[in the docs].


== Conclusion

To integrate an OptaPlanner service with your application on KIE Server:

1. Build the service as a KJAR.
2. Send an HTTP request to the KIE Server to start a container that runs this service.
3. Communicate with the service through the REST API the KIE Server exposes.
