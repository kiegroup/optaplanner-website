:showtitle:

As of version `6.0.0.Beta1`, *Drools Planner has been renamed to OptaPlanner*.

== Why change the name?

OptaPlanner is the new name for Drools Planner.
OptaPlanner is now standalone, but can still be optionally combined with the Drools rule engine for a powerful declarative approach to planning optimization.

* OptaPlanner has graduated from the http://www.jboss.org/drools[Drools] project to become a top-level http://www.jboss.org/[JBoss Community] project.

** OptaPlanner is not a fork of Drools Planner.
   We simply renamed it.

** OptaPlanner (the planning engine) joins its siblings Drools (the rule engine) and jBPM (the workflow engine) in the KIE group.

* Our commitment to Drools hasn't changed.

** The efficient Drools rule engine is still the recommended way to do score calculation.

** Alternative score calculation options, such as pure Java calculation (no Drools), also remain fully supported.

== How will this affect your business?

From a business point of view, there's *little or no change*:

* The mission remains unchanged:

** We're still 100% committed to put _business resource optimization_ in the hands of normal Java developers.

* The license remains unchanged:

** OptaPlanner still has the same open source license, Apache Software License 2.0.

* The release lifecycle remains unchanged:

** OptaPlanner is still released at the same time as Drools and jBPM.

* Red Hat is considering support subscription offerings for OptaPlanner as part of its http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/business-rules/[BRMS] and BPM platforms.

** A _Tech Preview_ of OptaPlanner is targeted for BRMS 6.0.

== What has changed?

* The website has changed to http://www.optaplanner.org[http://www.optaplanner.org].

* The distributions artifacts have changed name:

** Jar names changes:

*** `drools-planner-core-*.jar` is now `optaplanner-core-*.jar`

*** `drools-planner-benchmark-*.jar` is now `optaplanner-benchmark-*.jar`

** Maven identification groupId's and artifactId's changes:

*** groupId `org.drools.planner` is now `org.optaplanner`

*** artifactId `drools-planner-core` is now `optaplanner-core`

*** artifactId `drools-planner-benchmark` is now `optaplanner-benchmark`

** As usual, for more information see the Upgrade Recipe in the download zip.

* The API's namespace has changed.

** As usual, see https://github.com/droolsjbpm/optaplanner/blob/master/optaplanner-distribution/src/main/assembly/filtered-resources/UpgradeFromPreviousVersionRecipe.txt[the upgrade recipe] on how to deal with this efficiently.

** Starting from 6.1.0.Final, OptaPlanner will have a 100% backwards compatible API.

* OptaPlanner gets its own IRC channels on http://freenode.net/[Freenode]:

** `#optaplanner`

** `#optaplanner-dev`
