https://www.redhat.com[Red Hat] sponsors this Open Source project
and employs its core developers.
Additionally, Red Hat offers enterprise support and consultancy for this community _project_,
as part of Red Hat _product_ subscriptions.

== Community and product comparison

The community download delivers everything you would expect from an Open Source project,
including all features. The product subscription fills the missing gaps for enterprise use.
