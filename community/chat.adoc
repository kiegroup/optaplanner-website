==  Guidelines

* Answers can take a while. Wait at least an hour. If no one answers, then they are busy or AFK. Try the link:forum.html[forum] instead.
* Don't send private messages to anyone, use only the public channels. Private support is reserved for Red Hat customers only.
* No need to waste time by asking _"Can I ask a question?"_. Just ask your question immediately.
* If you need assistance with other JBoss projects, try their IRC channel on Freenode.
