== Why OptaPlanner 8?

To empower OptaPlanner on the latest technologies
and facilitate new features (see below),
OptaPlanner can't remain 100% backwards compatible.
Therefore, following _Apache version guidelines_, the major version number increments.
*OptaPlanner 8 removes the deprecated methods from OptaPlanner 7*
and makes a few minor backwards incompatible changes.
**Upgrading your code from 7 to 8 is easy and quick.**
Just follow the instructions in link:../upgradeRecipe/upgradeRecipe8.html[the upgrade recipe].

As usual, Red Hat offers link:../../product/services.html[enterprise support and consulting] on OptaPlanner 8,
with the _Red Hat build of OptaPlanner_ in an upcoming release of Red Hat Decision Manager 7
in the first half of 2021.

== New and noteworthy: Engine 8.5.0.Final

=== Better and faster Constraint Streams

The link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreams[Constraint Streams API] received a major new functionality.
You can now modify your streams using link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreamsMappingTuples[mapping functions].

Besides that, the API has seen further performance improvements.
In link:/blog/2021/03/04/OptimizingCovid19VaccinationScheduling.html[OptaPlanner vaccination scheduling], we have seen speedups of up to 50 %.

=== Ready for OpenJDK 16

We have made some tweaks under the hood
so that your experience with the recently released link:https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/16/[OpenJDK 16] continues to be smooth.

== New and noteworthy: Engine 8.3.0.Final

=== Major performance improvements for Constraint Streams

The default implementation of the link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreams[Constraint Streams API]
has seen major performance improvements.
Use cases with tri and quad streams may experience order of magnitude speedups.
Use cases with link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreamsGroupingAndCollectors[grouping]
are likely to experience some speedups too, albeit comparatively smaller.

Kudos to the link:https://drools.org/[Drools] team for helping make this possible!

=== Constraint Streams `groupBy()` overloads for multiple collectors

The link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreams[Constraint Streams API]
has been extended to allow using more than 2 collectors in a single link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latestFinal/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintStreamsGroupingAndCollectors[grouping].
The following is now possible:

[source,java]
----
return constraintFactory.from(ProductPrice.class)
    .groupBy(min(), max(), sum())
    .penalize(..., SimpleScore.ONE, (minPrice, maxPrice, sumPrices) -> ...);
----

== New and noteworthy: Engine 8.0.0.Final

=== OptaPlanner quickstarts repository

The new https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner-quickstarts[OptaPlanner Quickstarts repository]
contains pretty web demos for several use cases.
It also shows you how to integrate OptaPlanner with different technologies:

* *School timetabling*: Assign lessons to timeslots and rooms to produce a better schedule for teachers and students.
+
This application connects to a relational database and exposes a REST API, rendered by a pretty JavaScript UI.
+
** `quarkus-school-timetabling`: Java, Maven or Gradle, Quarkus, H2
** `spring-boot-school-timetabling`: Java, Maven or Gradle, Spring Boot, H2
** `kotlin-quarkus-school-timetabling`: Kotlin, Maven, Quarkus, H2
* *Facility location problem (FLP)*: Pick the best geographical locations for new stores, distribution centers, covid test centers or telco masts.
** `quarkus-facility-location`: Java, Maven, Quarkus
* *Factorio layout*: Assign machines to assembly line locations to design the best factory layout.
** `quarkus-factorio-layout`: Java, Maven, Quarkus
* Maintenance scheduling: Coming soon

=== Future Java compatibility

The OptaPlanner 8 API has been groomed to maximize compatibility
with the latest https://openjdk.java.net/[OpenJDK] and https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] releases
and game-changing platforms such as https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus].
Meanwhile, we still fully support OpenJDK 11 and platforms such as Spring Boot or plain Java.

For example, when running OptaPlanner in Java 11 or higher with a classpath,
OptaPlanner no longer triggers `WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred`
for XStream.

=== Code completion for solverConfig.xml and benchmarkConfig.xml through XSD

To validate XML configuration during development,
add the new XML Schema Definition (XSD) on the solver or benchmark configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<solver xmlns="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  ...
</solver>
----

This enables code completion for XML in most IDEs:

=== Improved Quarkus extension

The OptaPlanner Quarkus extension is now stable
and displays no warnings when compiling Java to a native executable.

=== ScoreManager now supports score explanation

The `ScoreManager` can now also explain why a solution has a certain score:

[source,java]
----
ScoreManager<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> scoreManager = ScoreManager.create(solverFactory);
...
ScoreExplanation<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> scoreExplanation = scoreManager.explain(timeTable);
System.out.println(scoreExplanation.getSummary());
...
----

Additionally, use `scoreExplanation.getConstraintMatchTotalMap()` and `scoreExplanation.getIndictmentMap()`
to extract the `ConstraintMatchTotal<HardSoftScore>` and `Indictment<HardSoftScore>` information without triggering a new score calculation.

=== Various improvements

* The ConstraintStreams API is now richer, more stable with better error messages and faster.
* The `SolverManager` API now supports to listen to both best solution events and the solving ended event.
* OptaPlanner no longer depends on Guava or Reflections.
