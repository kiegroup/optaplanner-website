= Upgrade recipe 8
:awestruct-description: Upgrade to OptaPlanner 8 from the previous version.
:awestruct-layout: upgradeRecipeBase
:awestruct-priority: 0.5
:awestruct-upgrade_recipe_version: 8

Because this is a new major version number (8.0), which is the foundation for the 8.x series for the next few years, it allows us to make backwards incompatible changes to the public API _for the long term benefit of this project_.

We kept these backwards incompatible changes to a strict minimum and will not introduce any additional ones during the 8.x era.

Any backwards incompatible changes are annotated with a [.label.label-danger.label-as-badge.label-public-api]#Public API# badge.

== Backwards incompatible changes to the public API since 7.x

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== Java 11 or higher required

If you're using JRE or JDK 8, upgrade to JDK 11 or higher.

JDK 11 or higher is still available for _free_ (including security and bug fixes),
alongside Oracle's paid subscription.

* On linux, get OpenJDK from your linux software repository.
For example on Fedora and RHEL:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo dnf install java-11-openjdk-devel
----

* On Windows and macOS, https://adoptopenjdk.net[download OpenJDK from AdoptOpenJDK].

We currently intend to support a minimal version of Java 11 throughout the entire 8.x series.

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SolverFactory` and `PlannerBenchmarkFactory` no longer support KIE containers

Due to OptaPlanner aligning to Kogito, the KIE container concept no longer applies.
Therefore, `SolverFactory` no longer allows to create `Solver` instances from KIE containers.
Likewise for `PlannerBenchmarkFactory` and benchmarks.

Users are encouraged to check out our
https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/tree/master/process-optaplanner-quarkus[OptaPlanner Kogito quickstart]
to see how to integrate with processes in a modern, cloud-native way.

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== OSGi metadata removed

Due to the limited usage of OSGi and the maintenance burden it brings, the OptaPlanner jars in the 8.x series no longer include OSGi metadata in their `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file.

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== Refrain from using Java serialization

Java serialization is
https://cr.openjdk.java.net/~briangoetz/amber/serialization.html[considered by its authors to be poorly designed] and it was suggested that the capability would, at some point in time, be removed from the platform altogether.
In OptaPlanner 8, we have removed most uses of the `Serializable` marker interface from the public API and we encourage users to
https://docs.optaplanner.org/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#integrationWithPersistentStorage[serialize
via JSON or other formats].

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SolverFactory.getScoreDirectorFactory()` replaced by `ScoreManager`

In version 7 of OptaPlanner, using `ScoreDirectorFactory` was necessary in order to
https://docs.optaplanner.org/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#explainingTheScore[explain the score].
In version 8, we have added new functionality to the `ScoreManager` and as a result, there is no longer any reason to create new instances of `ScoreDirector`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
ScoreDirectorFactory<CloudBalance> scoreDirectorFactory = solverFactory.getScoreDirectorFactory();
try (ScoreDirector<CloudBalance> scoreDirector = scoreDirectorFactory.buildScoreDirector()) {
    scoreDirector.setWorkingSolution(solution);
    Score score = scoreDirector.calculateScore();
}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
ScoreManager<CloudBalance> scoreManager = ScoreManager.create(solverFactory);
Score score = guiScoreDirector.updateScore(solution);
----

Methods that allowed users to retrieve an instance of `ScoreDirector` and `ScoreDirectorFactory` have been removed from public API without replacement.
A reduced version of the `ScoreDirector` interface was promoted to public API as part of promoting the
`ProblemFactChange` interface to public API.

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SolverFactory`: `getSolverConfig()` removed

The method `SolverFactory.getSolverConfig()` has long been deprecated in favor of `SolverFactory.create(SolverConfig)`.
A `SolverConfig` is now instantiated before a `SolverFactory` is instantiated, which is more natural.
The old way has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(".../mySolverConfig.xml");
SolverConfig solverConfig = solverFactory.getSolverConfig();
...
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource(".../mySolverConfig.xml");
...
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

If you were also passing a `ClassLoader`, pass it to both `SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource()` and `SolverFactory.create()`.

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SolverConfig`: `buildSolver()` removed

The method `SolverConfig.buildSolver()` is an inner method that doesn't belong in the public API.
Instead, use `SolverFactory.buildSolver()`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource(".../mySolverConfig.xml");
...
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverConfig.buildSolver();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = SolverConfig.createFromXmlResource(".../mySolverConfig.xml");
...
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `PlannerBenchmarkConfig`: `buildPlannerBenchmark()` removed

The method `PlannerBenchmarkConfig.buildPlannerBenchmark()` is an inner method that doesn't belong in the public API.
Instead, use `PlannerBenchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark()`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkConfig benchmarkConfig = PlannerBenchmarkConfig.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingBenchmarkConfig.xml");
...
PlannerBenchmark benchmark = benchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkConfig benchmarkConfig = PlannerBenchmarkConfig.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingBenchmarkConfig.xml");
...
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.create(benchmarkConfig);
PlannerBenchmark benchmark = benchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark();
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SolverFactory`: `cloneSolverFactory()` removed

The method `SolverFactory.cloneSolverFactory()` has long been deprecated in favor of the copy constructor
`new SolverConfig(SolverConfig)`.
It has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
private SolverFactory<MySolution> base;

public void userRequest(..., long userInput) {
    SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = base.cloneSolverFactory();
    solverFactory.getSolverConfig()
            .getTerminationConfig()
            .setMinutesSpentLimit(userInput);
    Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
    ...
}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
private SolverConfig base;

public void userRequest(..., long userInput) {
    SolverConfig solverConfig = new SolverConfig(base); // Copy it
    solverConfig.getTerminationConfig()
            .setMinutesSpentLimit(userInput);
    SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
    Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
    ...
}
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SolverFactory`: `createEmpty()` removed

The method `SolverFactory.createEmpty()` has long been deprecated in favor of `new SolverConfig()`.
It has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createEmpty();
SolverConfig solverConfig = solverFactory.getSolverConfig()
...
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverConfig solverConfig = new SolverConfig();
...
SolverFactory<MySolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.create(solverConfig);
Solver<MySolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== XML <solver/> root element now belongs to the https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver namespace
OptaPlanner now provides an XML Schema Definition for the solver configuration.
Although OptaPlanner keeps backward compatibility of the existing XML configuration,
migrating to the XSD is strongly recommended as OptaPlanner may support only valid configuration XML in the future.

Before in `*SolverConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<solver>
  ...
</solver>
----

After in `*SolverConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<solver xmlns="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/solver/solver.xsd">
  ...
</solver>
----

Using the XSD may require reordering some of the XML elements of the configuration.
Use code completion in the IDE to migrate to a valid XML.

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== Property `subPillarEnabled` in move selector configuration has been removed

The `subPillarEnabled` property on `PillarSwapMoveSelector` and `PillarChangeMoveSelector` has long been deprecated and replaced by a new property, `subPillarType`.
It has now been removed.

Before in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
      <pillar...MoveSelector>
        ...
        <pillarSelector>
          <subPillarEnabled>false</subPillarEnabled>
          ...
        </pillarSelector>
        ...
      </pillar...MoveSelector>
----

After in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
      <pillar...MoveSelector>
        <subPillarType>NONE</subPillarType>
        <pillarSelector>
          ...
        </pillarSelector>
        ...
      </pillar...MoveSelector>
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `Solver`: `getScoreDirectorFactory()` removed

The method `getScoreDirectorFactory()` has long been deprecated and has now been removed from both `Solver` and
`SolverFactory` classes.

Now you don't need to create a `Solver` instance just to calculate or explain a score in the UI.
Instead, use the `ScoreManager` API.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<VehicleRoutingSolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(...);
Solver<VehicleRoutingSolution> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
uiScoreDirectorFactory = solver.getScoreDirectorFactory();
...
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<VehicleRoutingSolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(...);
ScoreManager<VehicleRoutingSolution> scoreManager = ScoreManager.create(solverFactory);
...
----

`ScoreDirectorFactory` should not be used anymore, as it's always been outside the public API and all of its functionality is exposed in various parts of the public API.


[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `Solver.explainBestScore()` removed

The `explainBestScore()` method on the `Solver` interface has been deprecated in 7.x and now removed.
The same information can be obtained via the new `ScoreManager` API.

We continue to advise users not to parse the results of this method call in any way.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
solver = ...;
scoreExplanation = solver.explainBestScore();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
MySolution solution = ...;
ScoreManager<MySolution> scoreManager = ...;
scoreExplanation = scoreManager.explainScore(solution);
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== ``Solver``'s `getBestSolution()`, `getBestScore()` and `getTimeMillisSpent()` removed

Several methods on the `Solver` interface have been deprecated in 7.x and now removed.
The same information can be obtained by registering an `EventListener` via `Solver.addEventListener(...)`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
solver = ...;
solution = solver.getBestSolution();
score = solver.getBestScore();
timeMillisSpent = solver.getTimeMillisSpent();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
solver = ...;
solver.addEventListener(event -> {
    solution = event.getNewBestSolution();
    score = event.getNewBestScore();
    timeMillisSpent = event.getTimeMillisSpent();
});
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== Annotation scanning has been removed

The `<scanAnnotatedClasses/>` directive in solver configuration has been deprecated in 7.x and now removed.
Use the link:../../compatibility/quarkus.html[Quarkus extension] or
link:../../compatibility/springBoot.html[Spring Boot starter] to automatically scan for annotated classes instead.

Before in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<solver>
    ...
    <scanAnnotatedClasses/>
    ...
</solver>
----

After in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<solver>
    ...
    <solutionClass>...</solutionClass>
    <entityClass>...</entityClass>
    ...
</solver>
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== New package for `@PlanningFactProperty` and `@PlanningFactCollectionProperty`

The `@PlanningFactProperty` and `@PlanningFactCollectionProperty` now share the same package with other similar annotations, such as `@PlanningSolution`.
The old annotations have been deprecated in 7.x and now removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.solution.drools.ProblemFactCollectionProperty;
import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.solution.drools.ProblemFactProperty;
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.solution.ProblemFactCollectionProperty;
import org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.solution.ProblemFactProperty;
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `filterClassList` replaced by a single filterClass

The configuration of `EntitySelector`, `ValueSelector` and `MoveSelector` now has a single filter class in both the configuration API and the solver configuration XML.

In practice, you don't need multiple selection filter classes often, and you can always replace them by a single selection filter class which implements the logic of all of them.
Passing a single selection class now requires less boilerplate code.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
ValueSelectorConfig valueSelectorConfig = new ValueSelectorConfig();
valueSelectorConfig.setFilterClassList(Collections.singletonList(MySelectionFilterClass.class));
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
ValueSelectorConfig valueSelectorConfig = new ValueSelectorConfig();
valueSelectorConfig.setFilterClass(MySelectionFilterClass.class);
----

==== Replacing multiple selection filter classes with a single one

Before in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<swapMoveSelector>
  <entitySelector>
    <filterClass>com.example.FilterA</filterClass>
    <filterClass>com.example.FilterB</filterClass>
  </entitySelector>
</swapMoveSelector>
----

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
package com.example;
...
public class FilterA implements SelectionFilter<MySolution, MyPlanningEntity> {

    @Override
    public boolean accept(ScoreDirector<MySolution> scoreDirector, MyPlanningEntity selection) {
        return selection.getValue() < 500;
    }
}
----

[source,java]
----
package com.example;
...
public class FilterB implements SelectionFilter<MySolution, MyPlanningEntity> {

    @Override
    public boolean accept(ScoreDirector<MySolution> scoreDirector, MyPlanningEntity selection) {
        return selection.getOrder() == Order.ASC;
    }
}
----

After in `*.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<swapMoveSelector>
  <entitySelector>
    <filterClass>com.example.SingleEntityFilter</filterClass>
  </entitySelector>
</swapMoveSelector>
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
package com.example;
...
public class SingleEntityFilter implements SelectionFilter<MySolution, MyPlanningEntity> {

    @Override
    public boolean accept(ScoreDirector<MySolution> scoreDirector, MyPlanningEntity selection) {
        return selection.getValue() < 500 && selection.getOrder() == Order.ASC;
    }
}
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== `AcceptorConfig` renamed to LocalSearchAcceptorConfig

Impacts only configuration API, solver configuration XML remains intact.

Naming consistency with other local-search-specific configuration classes.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
LocalSearchPhaseConfig localSearchPhaseConfig = new LocalSearchPhaseConfig()
        .withAcceptorConfig(new AcceptorConfig().withEntityTabuSize(5));
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
LocalSearchPhaseConfig localSearchPhaseConfig = new LocalSearchPhaseConfig()
        .withAcceptorConfig(new LocalSearchAcceptorConfig().withEntityTabuSize(5));
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `Custom properties` XML configuration format changes

Impact only the solver configuration XML, specifically `<scoreDirectorFactory/>`, `<moveIteratorFactory/>`,
`<moveListFactory/>`, `<partitionedSearch/>` and `<customPhase/>`.

To enforce structure of the configuration XML in build time.

Before in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<partitionedSearch>
  <solutionPartitionerClass>com.example.MySolutionPartitioner</solutionPartitionerClass>
  <solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
    <partCount>4</partCount> <!-- a custom property -->
    <minimumProcessListSize>300</minimumProcessListSize> <!-- a custom property -->
  </solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
</partitionedSearch>
----

After in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<partitionedSearch>
  <solutionPartitionerClass>com.example.MySolutionPartitioner</solutionPartitionerClass>
  <solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
    <property name="partCount" value="4"/> <!-- a custom property -->
    <property name="minimumProcessListSize" value="300"/> <!-- a custom property -->
  </solutionPartitionerCustomProperties>
</partitionedSearch>
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `<variableNameInclude/>` elements are now wrapped by the `<variableNameIncludes/>` element

Impact only the solver configuration XML, specifically the `<swapMoveSelector/>` and `<pillarSwapMoveSelector/>`.

To enforce structure of the configuration XML in build time.

Before in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<swapMoveSelector>
  <variableNameInclude>variableA</variableNameInclude>
  <variableNameInclude>variableB</variableNameInclude>
</swapMoveSelector>
----

After in `*.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<swapMoveSelector>
  <variableNameIncludes>
    <variableNameInclude>variableA</variableNameInclude>
    <variableNameInclude>variableB</variableNameInclude>
  </variableNameIncludes>
</swapMoveSelector>
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `Solution` interface removed

`Solution` interface has long been deprecated for removal and has now been removed.
The same goes for `AbstractSolution`, only used by the Workbench.

Remove the `Solution` interface, annotate the `getScore()` method with `@PlanningScore`
and replace the `getProblemFacts()` method with a `@ProblemFactCollectionProperty` annotation directly on every problem fact getter (or field).

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance implements Solution<HardSoftScore> {

    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;
    ...

    private HardSoftScore score;

    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    public List<CloudComputer> getComputerList() {...}

    public HardSoftScore getScore() {...}
    public void setScore(HardSoftScore score) {...}

    public Collection<? extends Object> getProblemFacts() {
        List<Object> facts = new ArrayList<Object>();
        facts.addAll(computerList);
        ...
        return facts;
    }

}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance {

    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;
    ...

    private HardSoftScore score;

    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    @ProblemFactCollectionProperty
    public List<CloudComputer> getComputerList() {...}

    @PlanningScore
    public HardSoftScore getScore() {...}
    public void setScore(HardSoftScore score) {...}

}
----

For a single problem fact (which is not wrapped in a `Collection`), use the `@ProblemFactProperty` annotation, as shown below (with field annotations this time).

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance implements Solution<HardSoftScore> {

    private CloudParametrization parametrization;
    private List<CloudBuilding> buildingList;
    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;
    ...

    public Collection<? extends Object> getProblemFacts() {
        List<Object> facts = new ArrayList<Object>();
        facts.add(parametrization); // not a Collection
        facts.addAll(buildingList);
        facts.addAll(computerList);
        ...
        return facts;
    }

}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance {

    @ProblemFactProperty
    private CloudParametrization parametrization;
    @ProblemFactCollectionProperty
    private List<CloudBuilding> buildingList;
    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    @ProblemFactCollectionProperty
    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;
    ...

}
----

Don't add the `@ProblemFactCollectionProperty` annotation on getters (or fields) that have a `@PlanningEntityCollectionProperty` annotation.

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `BestSolutionChangedEvent`: `isNewBestSolutionInitialized()` removed

The method `BestSolutionChangedEvent.isNewBestSolutionInitialized()` has long been deprecated in favor of `BestSolutionChangedEvent.getNewBestSolution().getScore().isSolutionInitialized()`.
It has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    public void bestSolutionChanged(BestSolutionChangedEvent<CloudBalance> event) {
        if (event.isEveryProblemFactChangeProcessed()
                && event.isNewBestSolutionInitialized()) {
            ...
        }
    }
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    public void bestSolutionChanged(BestSolutionChangedEvent<CloudBalance> event) {
        if (event.isEveryProblemFactChangeProcessed()
                && event.getNewBestSolution().getScore().isSolutionInitialized()) {
            ...
        }
    }
----

However, if you also check `isFeasible()`, that's enough because it also checks if the solution is initialized.

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    public void bestSolutionChanged(BestSolutionChangedEvent<CloudBalance> event) {
        if (event.isEveryProblemFactChangeProcessed()
                // isFeasible() checks isSolutionInitialized() too
                && event.getNewBestSolution().getScore().isFeasible()) {
            ...
        }
    }
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `<valueSelector>`: `variableName` is now an attribute

When power tweaking move selectors, such as `<changeMoveSelector>`, in a use case with multiple planning variables, the `<variableName>` XML element has been replaced by a `variableName="..."` XML attribute.
This reduces the solver configuration verbosity.
After being deprecated for the entire 7.x series, the old way has now been removed.

Before in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
  <valueSelector>
    <variableName>room</variableName>
  </valueSelector>
----

After in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
  <valueSelector variableName="room"/>
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== Partitioned Search: `threadFactoryClass` removed

Now that `<solver>` has supported a `<threadFactoryClass>` element for a while, the `<threadFactoryClass>` element under `<partitionedSearch>` has been removed.

Before in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
  <solver>
    ...
    <partitionedSearch>
      <threadFactoryClass>...MyAppServerThreadFactory</threadFactoryClass>
      ...
    </partitionedSearch>
  </solver>
----

After in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
  <solver>
    <threadFactoryClass>...MyAppServerThreadFactory</threadFactoryClass>
    ...
    <partitionedSearch>
      ...
    </partitionedSearch>
  </solver>
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `SimpleDoubleScore` and `HardSoftDoubleScore` removed

The use of double-based score types has https://docs.optaplanner.org/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#avoidFloatingPointNumbersInScoreCalculation[long been frowned upon]
as it leads to score corruption.
They have finally been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class MyPlanningSolution {

    private SimpleDoubleScore score;

    ...

}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class MyPlanningSolution {

    private SimpleLongScore score;

    ...

}
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `Score.toInitializedScore()` removed

The `Score.toInitializedScore()` method has been deprecated in favor of `Score.withInitScore(int)` in 7.x, and now removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
score = score.toInitializedScore();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
score = score.withInitScore(0);
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== Various justification `Comparators` removed

The following `Comparator` implementations were deprecated in 7.x and now removed:

- `org.optaplanner.core.api.score.comparator.NaturalScoreComparator`
- `org.optaplanner.core.api.score.constraint.ConstraintMatchScoreComparator`
- `org.optaplanner.core.api.score.constraint.ConstraintMatchTotalScoreComparator`
- `org.optaplanner.core.api.score.constraint.IndictmentScoreComparator`

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
NaturalScoreComparator comparator = new NaturalScoreComparator();
ConstraintMatchScoreComparator comparator2 = new ConstraintMatchScoreComparator();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
Comparator<Score> comparator = Comparable::compareTo;
Comparator<ConstraintMatch> comparator2 = Comparator.comparing(ConstraintMatch::getScore);
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `FeasibilityScore` removed

The `FeasibilityScore` interface has been deprecated in 7.x and its only method `isFeasible()` moved to the `Score`

The interface has now been removed.

Users should refer to their ``Score``s by their ultimate type, for example `HardSoftScore` as opposed to `Score`.

=== `@PlanningEntity.movableEntitySelectionFilter` removed

The `movableEntitySelectionFilter` field on `@PlanningEntity` annotation has been deprecated in 7.x and a new field
`pinningFilter` has been introduced, the name of which bears a clear relation to the `@PlanningPin` annotation.
This filter implements a new `PinningFilter` interface, returning true if the entity is pinned, and false if movable.
The logic of this new filter is therefore inverted as compared to the old filter.

Users should update their `@PlanningEntity` annotations, supplying the new filter instead of the old.
The old field has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningEntity(movableEntitySelectionFilter = MyMovableEntitySelectionFilter.class)
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
@PlanningEntity(pinningFilter = MyPinningFilter.class)
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `@PlanningVariable.reinitializeVariableEntityFilter` removed

The `reinitializeVariableEntityFilter` field on `@PlanningVariable` annotation has been deprecated for removal in 7.x and now removed.

Users of this niche functionality should refer to the documentation on how to achieve the same result by
link:https://docs.optaplanner.org/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#nullablePlanningVariable[power-tweaking construction heuristics].

=== `*ScoreHolder` classes turned into interfaces

In OptaPlanner 7, `ScoreHolder` classes, used exclusively for
https://docs.optaplanner.org/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#droolsScoreCalculation[Drools score calculation], exposed a number of public methods which, if used, allowed the user to unintentionally corrupt or otherwise negatively affect their scores.

In OptaPlanner 8, these methods have been removed and the classes have been turned into interfaces.
You probably don't use any of the removed, potentially harmful methods, so there will be no impact on your code.

If that is not the case, you will find suitable replacements in the public API in areas of
https://docs.optaplanner.org/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#explainingTheScore[score explanation] and
https://docs.optaplanner.org/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#constraintConfiguration[constraint configuration].

[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== `ValueRangeFactory` class now final

`ValueRangeFactory` class is a factory class that has only static methods.
As such, there is no need for the users to extend this class, and it has therefore been made `final`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
class MyValueRangeFactory extends ValueRangeFactory {
    ...
}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
class MyValueRangeFactory {
    ...
}
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `ConstraintMatchTotal` and `Indictment` are now interfaces

`ConstraintMatchTotal` and `Indictment` classes have been converted into interfaces and in the process, their implementations were moved out of the public API, together with methods that allowed to mutate their state.
These methods were never intended for public API, and therefore there is no replacement for them.

You may still need the instances themselves if you choose to implement `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator`:

[source,java]
----
ConstraintMatchTotal maximumCapacityMatchTotal = new ConstraintMatchTotal(...);
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
ConstraintMatchTotal maximumCapacityMatchTotal = new DefaultConstraintMatchTotal(...);
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `ScoreManager`: generic type `Score` added

The `ScoreManager` and `ScoreExplanation` API's
now have a generic type `Score` to avoid downcasts in your code, for example from `Score` to `HardSoftScore`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    @Inject // or @Autowired
    ScoreManager<TimeTable> scoreManager;
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    @Inject // or @Autowired
    ScoreManager<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> scoreManager;
----

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    HardSoftScore score = (HardSoftScore) explanation.getScore();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    HardSoftScore score = explanation.getScore();
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major]
=== `ConstraintMatchTotal`, `ConstraintMatch` and `Indictment`: generic type `Score` added

Just like `ScoreManager` and `ScoreExplanation`, the `ConstraintMatchTotal`, `ConstraintMatch` and `Indictment` API's
now have a generic type `Score` to avoid downcasts in your code, for example from `Score` to `HardSoftScore`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    Map<String, ConstraintMatchTotal> constraintMatchTotalMap = scoreExplanation.getConstraintMatchTotalMap();
    ConstraintMatchTotal constraintMatchTotal = constraintMatchTotalMap.get(contraintId);
    HardSoftScore totalScore = (HardSoftScore) constraintMatchTotal.getScore();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    Map<String, ConstraintMatchTotal<HardSoftScore>> constraintMatchTotalMap = scoreExplanation.getConstraintMatchTotalMap();
    ConstraintMatchTotal<HardSoftScore> constraintMatchTotal = constraintMatchTotalMap.get(contraintId);
    HardSoftScore totalScore = constraintMatchTotal.getScore();
----

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    Map<Object, Indictment> indictmentMap = scoreExplanation.getIndictmentMap();
    Indictment indictment = indictmentMap.get(lesson);
    HardSoftScore totalScore = (HardSoftScore) indictment.getScore();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
    ScoreExplanation<TimeTable, HardSoftScore> explanation = scoreManager.explainScore(timeTable);
    Map<Object, Indictment<HardSoftScore>> indictmentMap = scoreExplanation.getIndictmentMap();
    Indictment<HardSoftScore> indictment = indictmentMap.get(lesson);
    HardSoftScore totalScore = indictment.getScore();
----


[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator`: generic type `Score` added

The interface `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator`
now also has a generic type parameter for `Score` to avoid raw type usages of `ConstraintMatchTotal` and `Indictment`.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class MachineReassignmentIncrementalScoreCalculator
        implements ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator<MachineReassignment> {

    @Override
    public Collection<ConstraintMatchTotal> getConstraintMatchTotals() {
        ...
    }


    @Override
    public Map<Object, Indictment> getIndictmentMap() {
        ...
    }

}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class MachineReassignmentIncrementalScoreCalculator
        implements ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator<MachineReassignment, HardSoftLongScore> {

    @Override
    public Collection<ConstraintMatchTotal<HardSoftLongScore>> getConstraintMatchTotals() {
        ...
    }


    @Override
    public Map<Object, Indictment<HardSoftLongScore>> getIndictmentMap() {
        ...
    }

}
----

[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== `AbstractCustomPhaseCommand` was removed

The abstract class `AbstractCustomPhaseCommand` was removed.
Any class that extends it should directly implement the `CustomPhaseCommand` interface.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class DinnerPartySolutionInitializer extends AbstractCustomPhaseCommand<DinnerParty> {

    @Override
    public void changeWorkingSolution(ScoreDirector<DinnerParty> scoreDirector) {
        ...
    }

}
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
public class DinnerPartySolutionInitializer implements CustomPhaseCommand<DinnerParty> {

    @Override
    public void changeWorkingSolution(ScoreDirector<DinnerParty> scoreDirector) {
        ...
    }

}
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major]
=== Score calculators become public API

The interfaces `EasyScoreCalculator`, `IncrementalScoreCalculator` and `ConstraintMatchAwareIncrementalScoreCalculator`
have moved to a new package in the public API.
Their deprecated counterparts have been removed.
The deprecated class `org.optaplanner.core.impl.score.director.incremental.AbstractIncrementalScoreCalculator`
has also been removed.
Replace the use of the removed interfaces and classes with their counterparts in the public API.

Before in `*EasyScoreCalculator.java*`:

[source,xml]
----
  ...
  import org.optaplanner.core.impl.score.director.easy.EasyScoreCalculator;
  ...

  public class CloudBalancingEasyScoreCalculator implements EasyScoreCalculator<CloudBalance> {

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `PlannerBenchmarkFactory`: `createFromSolverFactory()` removed

The method `PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverFactory()` has long been deprecated in favor of
`PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverConfigXmlResource(String)`.
It has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
SolverFactory<CloudBalance> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml");
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverFactory(solverFactory);
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverConfigXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingSolverConfig.xml");
----

If you programmatically adjust the solver configuration, you can use `PlannerBenchmarkConfig.createFromSolverConfig(SolverConfig)`
and then `PlannerBenchmarkFactory.create(PlannerBenchmarkConfig)` instead.

[.upgrade-recipe-minor.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `PlannerBenchmarkFactory`: `getPlannerBenchmarkConfig()` removed

The method `PlannerBenchmarkFactory.getPlannerBenchmarkConfig()` has long been deprecated in favor of
`PlannerBenchmarkFactory.create(PlannerBenchmarkConfig)`.
A `PlannerBenchmarkConfig` is now instantiated before a `PlannerBenchmarkFactory` is instantiated, which is more natural.
The old was has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingBenchmarkConfig.xml");
PlannerBenchmarkConfig benchmarkConfig = benchmarkFactory.getPlannerBenchmarkConfig();
...
PlannerBenchmark benchmark = benchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark();
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkConfig benchmarkConfig = PlannerBenchmarkConfig.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingBenchmarkConfig.xml");
...
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.create(benchmarkConfig);
PlannerBenchmark benchmark = benchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark();
----

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== XML <plannerBenchmark/> root element now belongs to the https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/benchmark namespace
OptaPlanner now provides an XML Schema Definition for the benchmark configuration.
Although OptaPlanner keeps backward compatibility of the existing XML configuration,
migrating to the XSD is strongly recommended as OptaPlanner may support only valid configuration XML in the future.

Before in `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<plannerBenchmark>
  ...
</plannerBenchmark>
----

After in `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<plannerBenchmark xmlns="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/benchmark" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/benchmark https://www.optaplanner.org/xsd/benchmark/benchmark.xsd">
  ...
</plannerBenchmark>
----

Using the XSD may require reordering some of the XML elements of the configuration.
Use code completion in the IDE to migrate to a valid XML.

[.upgrade-recipe-major.upgrade-recipe-public-api]
=== `ProblemBenchmarksConfig`: `xStreamAnnotatedClass` removed

The `<xStreamAnnotatedClass/>` has been removed from the `<problemBenchmarks/>` configuration together with  the corresponding
`getXStreamAnnotatedClassList()` and `setXStreamAnnotatedClassList()` methods in the `ProblemBenchmarksConfig` class.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
ProblemBenchmarksConfig problemBenchmarksConfig = new ProblemBenchmarksConfig();
problemBenchmarksConfig.setXStreamAnnotatedClassList(MySolution.class);

=== `BenchmarkAggregatorFrame`: `createAndDisplay(PlannerBenchmarkFactory)` removed

The method `BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplay(PlannerBenchmarkFactory)` has long been deprecated in favor of `BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplayFromXmlResource(String)`.
It has now been removed.

Before in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingBenchmarkConfig.xml");
BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplay(benchmarkFactory);
----

After in `*.java`:

[source,java]
----
BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplayFromXmlResource(
        ".../cloudBalancingBenchmarkConfig.xml");
----

If you programmatically adjust the benchmark configuration, you can use ``BenchmarkAggregatorFrame.createAndDisplay(PlannerBenchmarkConfig)` instead.

[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== Removed JavaScript expression support in configuration

Various elements of both the solver configuration and benchmark configuration no longer support nested
JavaScript expressions.
Users need to replace these with either auto-configuration or with integer constants.

A deprecated interface `VariableListener` from package `org.optaplanner.core.impl.domain.variable.listener` has ben removed,
along with a deprecated interface `StatefulVariableListener`
and a deprecated class `VariableListenerAdapter` in that same package.
Instead, use an interface `VariableListener` from package `org.optaplanner.core.api.domain.variable`.
