= Upgrade recipe 6.0
:awestruct-description: Upgrade to OptaPlanner 6.0 from a previous version.
:awestruct-layout: upgradeRecipeBase
:awestruct-priority: 0.5
:awestruct-upgrade_recipe_version: 6.0

== From 5.5.0.Final to 6.0.0.Alpha7

[.upgrade-recipe-readme]
=== Backwards compatible API in sight

Starting from 6.1.0.Final for 6.2, 6.3, ..., planner will have a backwards compatible API.
As preparation for that, every part of the API is being reviewed.

[.upgrade-recipe-recommended]
=== Important upgrade advice

Don't directly upgrade the jars to 6.0.0.Final.
In 6.0.0.Beta1, Drools Planner has been renamed to OptaPlanner and the java package structure has been changed severely.
Instead, upgrade the jars to 6.0.0.Alpha9 first.
Once that compiles, immediately upgrade the jars to your desired version and continue following the upgrade recipe.
The 6.0.0.Alpha9 jars are available in the maven repository and in this zip:
https://download.jboss.org/drools/release/6.0.0.Alpha9/drools-planner-distribution-6.0.0.Alpha9.zip

[.upgrade-recipe-readme]
=== `ValueRangeType.FROM_PLANNING_ENTITY_PROPERTY` fixed

`ValueRangeType.FROM_PLANNING_ENTITY_PROPERTY` now works. The regression in 5.5 from 5.4 has been fixed.

[.upgrade-recipe-recommended]
=== Planning variables `null` when initialized

Planning variables can now have a `null` value when initialized.
If you have any custom hacks for that, take a look at the reference manual how to replace them with a nullable variable.

=== `<assertionScoreDirectorFactory>`: config simplified

`<assertionScoreDirectorFactory>` no longer needs a `<scoreDefinition*>`: it inherits it from its parent.

=== Drools and `HardAndSoft*Score`: usage changed

If you are using Drools and `HardAndSoft*Score`:
`ConstraintType` no longer has `NEGATIVE_HARD`, `NEGATIVE_SOFT` and `POSITIVE`. It only has `HARD` and `SOFT` now.
As a result, all negative weights are now a negative number. All positive weights are now a positive number.
`HardAndSoft*ScoreHolder` replaced `setHardConstraintsBroken()` and `setSoftConstraintsBroken()`
with `setHardScore()` and `setSoftScore()`.

=== `Solution`: new annotation needed

Your `Solution` implementation class now needs a `@PlanningSolution` annotation

Before in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
public class ... implements Solution<...Score> {...}

@PlanningSolution
public class ... implements Solution<...Score> {...}

[.upgrade-recipe-major]
=== `Solution`: `cloneSolution(Solution)` removed

A `Solution` no longer need to implement the method `cloneSolution(Solution)`

Before in `*.java`:

public class Examination implements Solution<...> {
    ...
    public Examination cloneSolution() {
        Examination clone = new Examination();

    public Exam clone() {
        Exam clone = new Exam();
        ...
        return clone;
    }
}
----

After in `*.java`, option 1: if you want to use the automatic cloning system:
[source, java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class Examination implements Solution<...> {
    ...
}
public class Exam {
    ...
}
----

After in `*.java`, option 2: if you want keep your code:
[source, java]
----

public class Examination implements Solution<...>, PlanningCloneable<Examination> {
    ...
    public Examination planningClone() {
        Examination clone = new Examination();

=== Custom `ScoreDefinition` with 3 levels: use `HardMediumSoftScoreDefinition`

If you've defined a custom `ScoreDefinition` to be able to use 3 score levels of ints,
consider using the new `HardMediumSoftScoreDefinition` instead.

Before in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
    <scoreDefinitionType>HARD_MEDIUM_SOFT</scoreDefinitionType>

=== Construction Heuristics: behaviour change

The construction heuristics now immediately add all uninitialized entities
into the `ScoreDirector` (so into the `WorkingMemory`), instead of adding each entity just before initializing it.
This change improves consistency and compatibility of construction heuristics with multiple variables,
because they can now initialize 1 variable at a time instead of all variables.
Also, this change improves support for nullable variables.
Unfortunately, this means that in your score rules you might need to add a few or a lot of null checks,
which can be annoying if you have a lot of score rules.
If you don't use the constructions heuristics, no changes are required, but they are still highly recommended.

Note: even though your DRL code already needed to be planning variable null-safe (since 5.5),
these changes are different and still needed.

No changes needed in `*ScoreRules.drl`:
[source, drl]

=== XStream serialization of a `Solution`

If you store your solutions as XML and reused the example's XStream serialization technique,
you probably want to have a score serialized as such:
[source, xml]
----
<score>0hard/-130870soft</score>
----
instead of the current way (which writes the full classname of the `Score` implementation in the XML).

Before in `*.java`:

=== XStream serialization of a `Solution`: file impact

If you store your solutions as XML and reused the example's XStream serialization technique,

=== Packages split up into api, config and implementation classes

The packages now make a clear distinction between api, config and implementation classes.
Starting from 6.1 for future versions (6.2, 6.3, ...):

* The `api` namespaced classes *will* be backwards compatible.
* The `config` namespaced classes *will* be backwards compatible on an XML level only.
* The `impl` namespaced classes *will NOT* be backwards compatible.

Also, each artifact now has a unique package namespace. For example:

* `optaplanner-core*.jar`:
** `org.optaplanner.core`: this package contains all classes from this jar
*** `.api`
*** `.config`
*** `.impl`
* `optaplanner-benchmark*.jar`:
** `org.optaplanner.benchmark`: this package contains all classes from this jar
*** `.api`
*** `.config`
*** `.impl`

===  `ConstraintOccurrence` replaced

In score DRL's, the insertLogical `ConstraintOccurrence` technique has been replaced with the `ConstraintMatch` technique.
That new technique is much faster (see blog for details), easier to use and far less error-prone.
Unlike `ConstraintOccurrence`, `ConstraintMatch` doesn't care about the equals/hashcode implementations of your classes.
Also, the `ConstraintMatch` and `ConstraintMatchTotal` instances are designed to be reused outside Planner.

[.upgrade-recipe-major]
=== scoreDrl's: use `ConstraintMatch` technique

Change your scoreDrl's to use the `ConstraintMatch` technique.
Instead of doing an insertLogical of a `ConstraintOccurrence`, they now call `scoreHolder.add*ConstraintMatch()`
and no longer need to supply the infamous causes parameter.
In the DRL, the LHS (= when parts) remain unchanged: only the RHS (= then parts) change
and the `accumulate*Score` rules are removed.
First, backup the old DRL, so you can easily verify that the new DRL works exactly the same as the old one:
----
cp cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl cloudBalancingScoreRulesOld.drl

Before in `*ScoreRules.drl`, to delete:
[source, drl]
----
import org.optaplanner.core.impl.score.constraint.IntConstraintOccurrence;

...
rule "accumulateHardScore"
        salience -1
    when
        $hardTotal : Number() from accumulate(
            IntConstraintOccurrence(constraintType == ConstraintType.HARD, $weight : weight),
            sum($weight)
        )
    then
        scoreHolder.setHardScore($hardTotal.intValue());
end
rule "accumulateSoftScore"
    ...
end
----

Before in `*ScoreRules.drl` (hard constraints):
[source, drl]
----
rule "conflictingLecturesSameCourseInSamePeriod"
    when
        ...
    then
        insertLogical(new IntConstraintOccurrence("conflictingLecturesSameCourseInSamePeriod", ConstraintType.HARD,
                -1,
                $leftLecture, $rightLecture));
end
----

After in `*ScoreRules.drl`:
[source, drl]
----
rule "conflictingLecturesSameCourseInSamePeriod"
    when
        ...
    then
        scoreHolder.addHardConstraintMatch(kcontext, -1);
end
----

Before in `*ScoreRules.drl` (soft constraints):
[source, drl]
----
rule "computerCost"
    when
        ...
    then
        insertLogical(new IntConstraintOccurrence("computerCost", ConstraintType.SOFT,
                - $cost,
                $computer));
end
----

After in `*ScoreRules.drl`:
[source, drl]
----
rule "computerCost"
    when
        ...
    then
        scoreHolder.addSoftConstraintMatch(kcontext, - $cost);
end
----

Before in `*ScoreRules.drl` (SimpleScore):
[source, drl]
----
rule "multipleQueensHorizontal"
    when
        ...
    then
        insertLogical(new UnweightedConstraintOccurrence("multipleQueensHorizontal", $q1, $q2));
end
----

After in `*ScoreRules.drl`:
[source, drl]
----
rule "multipleQueensHorizontal"
    when
        ...
    then
        scoreHolder.addConstraintMatch(kcontext, -1);
end
----

Note: `kcontext` is a magic variable name automatically made available by Drools Expert in the RHS (= then part).

Note: The causes array parameter (for example `$leftLecture`, `$rightLecture`, `$computer`) is gone,
because it is automatically deduced from `kcontext`.

Warning: Because `ConstraintMatch` doesn't do an `insertLogical`, nor does it depends on the equals/hashcode of your objects,
there is a small chance that the `ConstraintOccurrence` counted a lower score (often unintentional by the author).

To detect this uncomment this code in `*SolverConfig.xml` to verify that the new DRL works exactly the same as the old one:
[source, xml]
----
<!--<environmentMode>FULL_ASSERT</environmentMode>-->
...
<scoreDirectorFactory>
  ...
  <scoreDrl>...ScoreRules.drl</scoreDrl>
  <!--<assertionScoreDirectorFactory>-->
    <!--<scoreDrl>...ScoreRulesOld.drl</scoreDrl>-->
  <!--</assertionScoreDirectorFactory>-->
</scoreDirectorFactory>
----
In 6.0 (not in 6.1), the score corruption analysis helps to identify the rule which behaves differently.
If it fails, it is because in the old way, 2 or more different fire events of a score rule inserted equal `ConstraintOccurrences`.
In the new way, every fire event of a score rule adds a unique `ConstraintMatch`
(there's a 1 to 1 relationship - which is expected by most users anyway).

Important: The class `ConstraintOccurrence` will be removed in 6.1.0.Final, so switch to `ConstraintMatch` now.
The only reason why `ConstraintOccurrence` has not been removed already,
is to make the migration easier: so you can easily verify that after migration to `ConstraintMatch`, it gives the exact same scores, but faster.

Note: The examples still include their old drl variant too until 6.0.0.Beta4, if you want to use it for comparison.

=== `ConstraintOccurrence` outside usage: use `ConstraintMatch`

If you use `ConstraintOccurrence` outside of Planner itself, in the gui or your middleware,
for example, to show the user the constraint matches, switch to using `ConstraintMatch` and `ConstraintMatchTotal` instead.

Before in `*.java`:

    KieSession kieSession = ((DroolsScoreDirector) guiScoreDirector).getKieSession();
    if (kieSession == null) {
        return Collections.emptyList();
    }
    Collection<ConstraintOccurrence> constraintOccurrences = (Collection<ConstraintOccurrence>)
            kieSession.getObjects(new ClassObjectFilter(ConstraintOccurrence.class));
    for (ConstraintOccurrence constraintOccurrence : constraintOccurrences) {
        ScoreDetail scoreDetail = scoreDetailMap.get(constraintOccurrence.getRuleId());
        if (scoreDetail == null) {
            scoreDetail = new ScoreDetail(constraintOccurrence.getRuleId(), constraintOccurrence.getConstraintType());
            scoreDetailMap.put(constraintOccurrence.getRuleId(), scoreDetail);
        }
        scoreDetail.addConstraintOccurrence(constraintOccurrence);
    }
    List<ScoreDetail> scoreDetailList = new ArrayList<ScoreDetail>(scoreDetailMap.values());
    Collections.sort(scoreDetailList);
    return scoreDetailList;
----

After in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
public List<ConstraintMatchTotal> getConstraintMatchTotalList() {
    List<ConstraintMatchTotal> constraintMatchTotalList = new ArrayList<ConstraintMatchTotal>(
            guiScoreDirector.getConstraintMatchTotals());

----

Before in `*.java`:

=== `VehicleRouting` example rewritten

The `VehicleRouting` example has been rewritten to take advantage of Variable Listeners.
This makes it easier to implement time windowed vehicle routing.
A variable listener is triggered when the variable (`previousStandstill`) changes
and updates a shadow variable (`vehicle`, `arrivalTime`) accordingly.

[.upgrade-recipe-major]
=== `<subChainChangeMoveSelector>` and `<subChainSwapMoveSelector>`: behaviour changed

The generic moves `<subChainChangeMoveSelector>` and `<subChainSwapMoveSelector>`
no longer signal `Drools/IncrementalScoreCalculator` that an entity has changed when the anchor of an entity changes
if none of the actual planning variables of the entity changed.
So if you have shadow variable representing the anchor (for example the vehicle in VRP) this might cause score corruption.
Instead, add a variable listener to update the shadow variable and signal the `ScoreDirector` accordingly.

Before in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
public class VrpCustomer ... {
    // Planning variables: changes during planning, between score calculations.
    protected VrpStandstill previousStandstill;
    @PlanningVariable(chained = true) ...
    public VrpStandstill getPreviousStandstill() {
        return previousStandstill;
    }
    public VrpVehicle getVehicle() {
        // HACK
        VrpStandstill firstStandstill = getPreviousStandstill();
        while (firstStandstill instanceof VrpCustomer) {
            if (firstStandstill == this) {
                throw new IllegalStateException("Impossible state"); // fail fast during infinite loop
            }
            firstStandstill = ((VrpCustomer) firstStandstill).getPreviousStandstill();
        }
        return (VrpVehicle) firstStandstill;
    }
    ...
}
----

After in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
public class VrpCustomer ... {
    // Planning variables: changes during planning, between score calculations.
    protected VrpStandstill previousStandstill;
    // Shadow variable
    protected VrpVehicle vehicle;
    @PlanningVariable(chained = true, variableListenerClasses = {VehicleUpdatingVariableListener.class}) ...
    public VrpStandstill getPreviousStandstill() {
        return previousStandstill;
    }
    public VrpVehicle getVehicle() {
        return vehicle;
    }
    ...
}
----
To make it easier to implement that listener, a bi-directional relationship was introduced on `VrpStandstill`,
which made `VrpStandstill` a `@PlanningEntity` (which effectively makes `VrpVehicle` a planning entity too)
and `Solution.getVehicleList()` 's method annotated with `@PlanningEntityCollectionProperty`:

Before in `VrpStandstill.java`:
[source, java]
----
public interface VrpStandstill {
    ...
}
----

After in `VrpStandstill.java`:
[source, java]
----
@PlanningEntity
public interface VrpStandstill {
    ...
    @PlanningVariable(mappedBy = "previousStandstill") // Bi-directional relationship. This is the shadow side
    VrpCustomer getNextCustomer();
    void setNextCustomer(VrpCustomer nextCustomer);
}

`SolverConfig` 's method `setPlanningEntityClassSet()` has changed into `setPlanningEntityClassList()`
because the order is important.

=== `XStreamProblemIO` uses a vanilla `XStream`

`XStreamProblemIO` has been modified to use a vanilla `XStream` instance (but still with ID_REFERENCES)
instead of a complex construction to avoid an issue that has been fixed meanwhile.
Before it did:
[source, java]
----
xStream = new XStream(new PureJavaReflectionProvider(new FieldDictionary(new NativeFieldKeySorter())));
xStream.setMode(XStream.ID_REFERENCES);
----
Now it simply does:
[source, java]
----
xStream = new XStream();
xStream.setMode(XStream.ID_REFERENCES);
----
Normally this should have no relevant impact on your XML dataset files or your code.

=== Construction Heuristics rewritten

The construction heuristics have been rewritten from scratch to take advantage of the selector architecture.
The basic configuration hasn't changed much, but power users can now optionally do advanced configuration too.
These advanced options allow you to use construction heuristics with multiple entity classes,
a higher number of variables, nullable variables, ...

[.upgrade-recipe-major]
=== `<constructionHeuristicPickEarlyType>` renamed

The construction heuristic property `<constructionHeuristicPickEarlyType>` has been renamed to `<pickEarlyType>`.
The value `FIRST_LAST_STEP_SCORE_EQUAL_OR_IMPROVING` has been renamed to `FIRST_NON_DETERIORATING_SCORE`.
The `<pickEarlyType>` has been nested into a `<forager>` element (similar like for Local Search).

Before in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:
[source, xml]

=== Multiple planning variables: impact by Construction Heuristics refactor

If you have multiple variables, the result of the Construction Heuristics is likely to differ.
Even though the default still does a cartesian production over the variables for the FIT algorithm you choose,
it will order the combinations in the original order (instead of reverse order as the old implementation did by accident),
which might cause it to take a totally different path.

Note: Through advanced configuration it's possible to make the new implementation behave exactly the same as the old,
but this is *NOT* recommended:
[source, xml]
----
  <constructionHeuristic>
     ...
     <queuedEntityPlacer>
       <entitySelector id="placerEntitySelector">
         <cacheType>PHASE</cacheType>

=== `@ValueRange`: `excludeUninitializedPlanningEntity` removed

The `@ValueRange` property `excludeUninitializedPlanningEntity` has been removed.
Planner now does the right thing automatically for a chained variable.

Before in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
@PlanningVariable(chained = true, ...)
@ValueRanges({...,
        @ValueRange(type = ValueRangeType.FROM_SOLUTION_PROPERTY, solutionProperty = "customerList",
                excludeUninitializedPlanningEntity = true)})
public VrpStandstill getPreviousStandstill() {...}
----

After in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
@PlanningVariable(chained = true, ...)
@ValueRanges({...,
        @ValueRange(type = ValueRangeType.FROM_SOLUTION_PROPERTY, solutionProperty = "customerList")})
public VrpStandstill getPreviousStandstill() {...}
----
If you used it on a non-chained variable (which is highly unlikely), look into `ValueSelector` filtering
and let us know that such use cases exist (by creating a jira in our issue tracker).

[.upgrade-recipe-major]
=== `ValueRangeType.FROM_SOLUTION_PROPERTY` and `ValueRangeType.FROM_ENTITY_PROPERTY` removed

The annotation `@ValueRange` on a planning variable has been replaced by
`@ValueRangeProvider` on the providing method itself and `@PlanningVariable(valueRangeProviderRefs)` on planning variable.
`ValueRangeType.FROM_SOLUTION_PROPERTY` has been removed:

Before in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
@PlanningEntity
public class CloudProcess ... {
    ...
    @PlanningVariable()
    @ValueRange(type = ValueRangeType.FROM_SOLUTION_PROPERTY, solutionProperty = "computerList")
    public CloudComputer getComputer() {
        return computer;
    }
}
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance ... {
    ...
    public List<CloudComputer> getComputerList() {
        return computerList;
    }
}
----

After in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
@PlanningEntity
public class CloudProcess ... {
    ...
    @PlanningVariable(valueRangeProviderRefs = {"computerRange"})
    public CloudComputer getComputer() {
        return computer;
    }
}
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance ... {
    ...
    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    public List<CloudComputer> getComputerList() {
        return computerList;
    }
}
----
Consequently, the annotation `@ValueRanges` has been removed.

Before in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
@PlanningEntity
public class Visit ... {
    ...
    @PlanningVariable(chained = true)
    @ValueRanges({

    public Standstill getPreviousStandstill() {...}
}

public class TravelingSalesmanTour ... {
    ...
    public List<Domicile> getDomicileList() {...}

=== VRP example calculations improved

The VRP example's now calculates the distance and time more accurately.
To avoid floating-point arithmetic with `HardSoftDoubleScore` (which causes rounding errors and score corruption)
and to avoid a performance loss with `HardSoftBigDecimalScore`,
all distances and times have been multiplied by 1000 so it can continue to use `HardSoftScore` (which uses ints).

=== `<acceptor>` requires configuration

If the `<acceptor>` element has no configuration, it now fail-fast.
It used to default to `entityTabuSize` 7. To continue that behaviour, configure it explicitly.

=== `MoveListFactory` generified

The interface `MoveListFactory` now has a generic type (which extends `Solution`)
that is used as the parameter in the `createMoveList()` method.

public class RowChangeMoveFactory implements MoveListFactory {
    public List<Move> createMoveList(Solution solution) {
        NQueens nQueens = (NQueens) solution;

[.upgrade-recipe-minor]
=== `ConstraintMatch`: `getConstraintMatchTotal()` removed

`ConstraintMatch` no longer has a `getConstraintMatchTotal()` method
because a `ConstraintMatch` can survive many Local Search steps, but its Total (which holds a `Set`) should not survive.
Instead it has `getConstraintPackage()`, `getConstraintName()` and `getScoreLevel()`.
