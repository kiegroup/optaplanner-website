The US presidential election has an interesting voting system.
The winner is not the most popular candidate (he or she that has the most votes)
but the one that collects the most EC electors.
So I wonder, how could I become the least popular US president?
That's a constraint satisfaction problem!

It occurred https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_elections_in_which_the_winner_lost_the_popular_vote[a few times already]
that the president-elect didn't have the popular vote, most recently last month with Clinton vs. Trump.
But the difference in total votes wasn't that big. What would be the biggest possible gap?
If everyone voted against me by default, what's the minimum number of people I'd have to convince to vote for me to become US president?

== How is this possible?

This is due to the winner-takes-all system per state.
Any candidate that has the majority in one state (so at least 50% of the votes),
gets all Electoral College votes of that state.
So it doesn't matter if I get 51% or 99% of the votes in one state: I get the same number of EC votes.

Furthermore, the EC votes for one state do not represent its population accurately.
The EC votes are rounded to an integer and each state gets at least 3 out of 538 votes.
For example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)[an electoral vote represents nearly four
times as many people in California as in Wyoming].

Let's not elaborate on the fairness or unfairness of this system - I am sure we all have an opinion, but it is what it is.
Instead, let me put on my megalomaniac hat and see how I can *game the system to win the US elections with the least possible votes*.

== Constraints

I'll presume everyone votes, so my victory is assured regardless if they do or not.
If no one voted, I could in theory win the elections with 11 votes: 1 vote per state in each of the 11 most populous states.

I'll also presume no one votes for 3rd party candidates, so my victory is also assured regardless if anyone does or doesn't.

That leaves me with 2 constraints:

. Hard constraint: Collect at least 270 EC votes.
. Soft constraint: Minimize the number of votes for me.

To win a state, I'll just convince exactly half of its population plus one to vote for me.
The population data is from 2015 and https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner-training/blob/master/optaplanner-training-lab901-solution/data/election/import/president2016.txt[available in this file].

Now, let's solve this constraint satisfaction problem with https://www.optaplanner.org[OptaPlanner]!

== How to guarantee election victory with a quarter of the votes

*If I win these states with `21.73%` of the US population voting for me,
I am the next US president, regardless of how the other `78.27%` of the population votes!*

----

So even if everyone votes and no one votes for 3rd party candidates,
I am still guaranteed to win the US presidential election with less than a quarter of the total votes to my name.
I just need to win http://www.270towin.com/maps/7A3OW[the correct states] by one vote above half each.

== How did I find that solution?

I created a model in which all of 50 federal states are assigned to 1 out of 2 candidates.
I didn't try all `2^50` possible combinations, as that would take too long.

A simple Construction Heuristic that just takes the states with the highest votes to population ratio first,
gives me http://www.270towin.com/maps/wJpBe[this result]:

image::electionMapSimpleHeuristic.png[]

That's not optimal: it requires `0.02%` of the population too much.
By doing a Local Search algorithm on top of that, I get the better solution as shown earlier.
This algorithm basically swaps Arizona and Missouri for Pennsylvania.

The implementation is part of https://www.optaplanner.org/learn/training.html[the training zip].
This is really just a variant of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem[the knapsack problem].

== Conclusion

Even in political elections, constraint solvers are (ab)useful.
Not just for this use case, but also for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering[gerrymandering].

Note: The premise of this story is hypothetical: I have no actual ambitions to become US president.

== Update

There's https://youtu.be/7wC42HgLA4k?t=4m30s[a video] that claims that the optimal combination is different:

----

Instead of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Washington, it includes Missouri, Arizona, Virginia and New Jersey.
But as you can easily see, it's suboptimal because it needs `21.79%` of the votes,
which is higher than my earlier result of `21.73%`.
This is an apples to apples comparison on the 2015 population data,
so earlier population data might yield different results (and it might have been optimal at the time).
