What is the fastest way to read a getter from a Java class without knowing the class at compilation time?
Java frameworks often do this. A lot. And it can directly influence their performance.
So let's benchmark different approaches, such as reflection, method handles and code generation.

== The use case

Presume we have a simple `Person` class with a name and an address:

[source,java]
----
public class Person {
   ...

   public String getName() {...}
   public Address getAddress() {...}

}
----

and we want to use frameworks such as:

- http://x-stream.github.io/[XStream], JAXB or https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson] to serialize instances to XML or JSON.
- http://hibernate.org/[JPA/Hibernate] to store persons in a database.
- https://www.optaplanner.org/[OptaPlanner] to assign addresses (in case they're tourists or homeless).

image::reflectionButFasterUseCase.png[]

_None of these frameworks know the `Person` class._ So they can't simply call `person.getName()`:

[source,java]
----
   // Framework code
   public Object executeGetter(Object object) {
      // Compilation error: class Person is unknown to the framework
      return ((Person) object).getName();
   }
----

Instead, the code uses reflection, method handles or code generation.

But _such code is called an awful lot_:

* If you insert 1000 different persons in a database, JPA/Hibernate probably calls such code 2000 times:
** 1000 calls to `Person.getName()`
** another 1000 calls to `Person.getAddress()`
* Similarly, if you write 1000 different persons to XML or JSON, there are likely 2000 calls by XStream, JAXB or Jackson.

Obviously, when such code is called x times per second, *its performance matters*.

== The benchmarks

Using JMH, I ran a set of micro benchmarks using OpenJDK 1.8.0_111 on Linux
on a 64-bit 8-core Intel i7-4790 desktop with 32GB RAM.
The JMH benchmark ran with 3 forks, 5 warmup iterations of 1 second and 20 measurement iterations of 1 second.

The source code of https://github.com/ge0ffrey/ge0ffrey-presentations/blob/master/code/fasterreflection/fasterreflection-client/src/main/java/be/ge0ffrey/presentations/fasterreflection/client/FasterReflectionClientBenchmark.java[that benchmark]
is in https://github.com/ge0ffrey/ge0ffrey-presentations/tree/master/code/fasterreflection[this GitHub repository].

== The TL;DR results

* *Java Reflection is slow.*
* *Java MethodHandles are slow too.*
* *Generated code with `javax.tools` is fast.*

Of course, the devil is in the details.
So let's go through the implementations,
to confirm I applied typical magical tricks (such as `setAccessible(true)`).

== Implementations

=== Direct access (baseline)

I've used a normal `person.getName()` call as the baseline:

[source,java]
----
public final class MyAccessor {

    public Object executeGetter(Object object) {
        return ((Person) object).getName();
    }

}
----

This takes about 2.7 nanoseconds per operation:

----
Benchmark           Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units
===================================================
DirectAccess        avgt   60  2.667 ± 0.028  ns/op
----

*Direct access is naturally the fastest approach at runtime, with no bootstrap cost.
But it imports `Person` at compilation time, so it's unusable by every framework.*

=== Reflection

The obvious way for a framework read that getter at runtime, without knowing it in advance,
is through Java Reflection:

[source,java]
----
public final class MyAccessor {

    private final Method getterMethod;

    public MyAccessor() {
        getterMethod = Person.class.getMethod("getName");
        // Skip Java language access checking during executeGetter()
        getterMethod.setAccessible(true);
    }

    public Object executeGetter(Object bean) {
        return getterMethod.invoke(bean);
    }

}
----

Adding `setAccessible(true)` call makes these reflection calls faster,
but even then it takes 5.5 nanoseconds per call.

----

===================================================
DirectAccess        avgt   60  2.667 ± 0.028  ns/op
Reflection          avgt   60  5.511 ± 0.081  ns/op
----

*Reflection is 106% slower than direct access (so about twice as slow).*
It also takes longer to warm up.

This wasn't a big surprise to me,
because when I profile (using sampling) an artificially simple
https://www.optaplanner.org/learn/useCases/vehicleRoutingProblem.html[Traveling Salesman Problem]
with 980 cities in https://www.optaplanner.org/[OptaPlanner],
the reflection cost sticks out like a sore thumb:

=== MethodHandles

MethodHandle was introduced in java 7 to support _invokedynamic_ instructions.
According to the javadoc, it's _a typed, directly executable reference to an underlying method._
Sounds fast, right?

[source,java]
----
public final class MyAccessor {

    private final MethodHandle getterMethodHandle;

    public MyAccessor() {
        MethodHandle temp = lookup.findVirtual(Person.class, "getName", MethodType.methodType(String.class));
        temp = temp.asType(temp.type().changeParameterType(0 , Object.class));
        getterMethodHandle = temp.asType(temp.type().changeReturnType(Object.class));
    }

    public Object executeGetter(Object bean) {
        return getterMethodHandle.invokeExact(bean);
    }

}
----

Well unfortunately, *MethodHandle is even slower than reflection* in OpenJDK 8.
It takes 6.1 nanoseconds per operation, so 132% slower than direct access.

----
Benchmark           Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units
===================================================
DirectAccess        avgt   60  2.667 ± 0.028  ns/op
Reflection          avgt   60  5.511 ± 0.081  ns/op
MethodHandle        avgt   60  6.188 ± 0.059  ns/op
StaticMethodHandle  avgt   60  5.481 ± 0.069  ns/op
----

That being said, if the MethodHandle is in a static field, it takes only 5.5 nanoseconds per operation,
which is _still as slow as reflection_. Besides, that's unusable for most frameworks.
For example,  a JPA implementation might need to reflect
over `n` classes (`Person`, `Company`, `Order`, ...)'s `m` getters (`getName()`, `getAddress()`, `getBirthDate()`, ...),
so how can a JPA implementation have `n * m` static fields without knowing `n` nor `m` at compile time?

I do hope that MethodHandle will become as fast as direct access in future Java versions, replacing the need for...

=== Generated code with javax.tools.JavaCompiler

In Java, it's possible to compile and run generated Java code at runtime.
So with the `javax.tools.JavaCompiler` API, we can generate the direct access code at runtime:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class MyAccessor {

    public static MyAccessor generate() {
        final String String fullClassName = "x.y.generated.MyAccessorPerson$getName";
        final String source = "package x.y.generated;\n"
                + "public final class MyAccessorPerson$getName extends MyAccessor {\n"
                + "    public Object executeGetter(Object bean) {\n"
                + "        return ((Person) object).getName();\n"
                + "    }\n"
                + "}";
        JavaFileObject fileObject = new ...(fullClassName, source);

        JavaCompiler compiler = ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();
        ClassLoader classLoader = ...;
        JavaFileManager javaFileManager = new ...(..., classLoader)
        CompilationTask task = compiler.getTask(..., javaFileManager, ..., singletonList(fileObject));
        boolean success = task.call();
        ...
        Class compiledClass = classLoader.loadClass(fullClassName);
        return compiledClass.newInstance();
    }

    // Implemented by the generated subclass
    public abstract Object executeGetter(Object object);

}
----

For more information on how to use `javax.tools.JavaCompiler`,
take a look at http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2027052&seqNum=2[page 2 of this article]
or https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jcomp/index.html[this article].
Besides `javax.tools`, similar approaches can use ASM or CGLIB,
but those infer extra dependencies and might have different performance results.

In any case, *the generated code is as fast as direct access*:

[source, txt]
----
Benchmark           Mode  Cnt  Score   Error  Units
===================================================
DirectAccess        avgt   60  2.667 ± 0.028  ns/op
GeneratedCode       avgt   60  2.745 ± 0.025  ns/op
----

So when I ran that exact same
https://www.optaplanner.org/learn/useCases/vehicleRoutingProblem.html[Traveling Salesman Problem]
again in https://www.optaplanner.org/[OptaPlanner],
this time using code generation to access planning variables, _the score calculation speed was 18% faster overall_.
And the profiling (using sampling) looks much better too:

image::codeGenerationTspIncrementalCalculationSamplingProfiler.png[link="codeGenerationTspIncrementalCalculationSamplingProfiler.png" role="thumbnail"]

Note that in normal use cases, that performance gain will hardly be detectable,
due to massive CPU needs of a realistically complex score calculation...

The only downside of code generation at runtime is that it infers a noticeable bootstrap cost,
especially if the generated code isn't compiled in bulk.
So I am still hoping that some day MethodHandles will get as fast as direct access, just to avoid that bootstrap cost.

== Conclusion

Reflection and MethodHandles are twice as slow as direct access in OpenJDK 8.
Generated code is as fast as direct access.
