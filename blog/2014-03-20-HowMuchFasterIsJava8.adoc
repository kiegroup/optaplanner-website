Java SE 8 was https://blogs.oracle.com/java/entry/java_se_8_is_now[released] yesterday.
Traditionally, every new major JRE version comes with a free performance boost.
Do we get another free lunch? And how big is the gain this time?

Let's benchmark it.

== Benchmark methodology

* Run the same code with 3 different JRE versions (SunJDK `1.6.0_26`, OpenJDK `1.7.0_51` and OpenJDK `1.8.0`).
The code itself was written for Java 6 (both in syntax and JDK API's usage) and compiled for Java 6 with OpenJDK 1.7.

* Each run takes about 55 minutes.

* VM arguments: `-Xmx1536M -server` +
Software: `Linux 3.2.0-59-generic-pae` +
Hardware: `IntelÂ® Xeon(R) CPU W3550 @ 3.07GHz`

* Each run solves 13 planning problems with https://www.optaplanner.org[OptaPlanner].
Each planning problem runs for 5 minutes. It starts with a 30 second JVM warm up which is discarded.

* Solving a planning problem involves *no IO* (except a few milliseconds during startup to load the input).
*A single CPU is completely saturated.*
It constantly creates many short lived objects, and the GC collects them afterwards.

* The benchmarks measure the number of scores that can be calculated per millisecond. Higher is better.
Calculating a score for a proposed planning solution is non-trivial:
it involves many calculations, including checking for conflicts between every entity and every other entity.

To reproduce these benchmarks locally, https://www.optaplanner.org/code/sourceCode.html[build optaplanner from source]
and run the main class
https://github.com/kiegroup/optaplanner/blob/master/optaplanner-examples/src/main/java/org/optaplanner/examples/app/GeneralOptaPlannerBenchmarkApp.java[GeneralOptaPlannerBenchmarkApp].

== Benchmark results

=== Executive summary

image::jdk6vs7vs8Summary.png[]

My observations:

* On the biggest dataset (Machine Reassignment B10), which dwarfs any of the other datasets in size,
Java 8 is `20%` faster than Java 7, which was already `17%` faster than Java 6.

* In some cases, Java 8 is slower than Java 7.
Specially for the course scheduling datasets, Java 8 is `6%` slower than Java 7.
Hopefully new releases of Java 8 will resolve this performance regression soon.

* On average, Java 8 is only `1%` faster than Java 7. This while Java 7 is already `16%` faster than Java 6.

* Despite that this is the first final release of OpenJDK 8, I did not find any regressions in Java 8.
OptaPlanner's examples are 100% reproducible, so as expected, the different JRE's give the exact same results at every single iteration.

== Conclusion

On the big datasets, Java 8 is clearly faster. And this without changing a line of code.
On average, the result is less convincing (with the current release), but a free lunch is always welcome.

== Update (18-JUN-2015): Java 8 build 0 versus build 45

I wrote this blog more than a year ago. Meanwhile both Java 8 and OptaPlanner have had a number of releases.
*How much do the Java 8 updates affect performance?*

To make a fair comparison, I 've (re)ran the latest OptaPlanner code on both the original Java 8 release (build 0) and the latest release (build 45).
These are the results:

On average, Java 8 build 45 is `2.07%` faster than Java 8 build 0. That's welcome!
