KIE Server provides separation of execution environment from your client application,
making it easy to use OptaPlanner outside Java ecosystem (e.g. .NET).
In the 7 release stream, we worked to improve OptaPlanner/KIE Server integration.
The new API is less verbose and more intuitive.
Let's take a closer look at its usage in more detail.

== How a typical workflow looks like?

. Install your optimization app kjar to a maven repository accessible by the KIE Server.
This step assumes the following conditions are met:

* `kmodule.xml` file is located in `META-INF` folder of your project.
* Project uses packaging type `kjar`.
* `kie-maven-plugin` is configured for the project.

----
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.kie</groupId>
        <artifactId>kie-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${version.org.kie}</version>
        <extensions>true</extensions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
----

. Create a container (server unit of execution) wrapping the project.
This example uses Java KIE Server client, which performs REST calls in the background.
+
The following dependencies are required in your client application.
Make sure to use version 7.0.0.Final, or later.
+
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.kie.server</groupId>
    <artifactId>kie-server-api</artifactId>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.kie.server</groupId>
    <artifactId>kie-server-client</artifactId>
  </dependency>
----
Client and container creation:
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
  KieServicesConfiguration kieServicesConfiguration = new KieServicesConfigurationImpl(SERVER_URL, USERNAME, PASSWORD, CLIENT_TIMEOUT);
  KieServicesClient kieServicesClient = KieServicesFactory.newKieServicesClient(kieServicesConfiguration)

  // ReleaseId corresponds to groupId:artifactId:version (GAV) of the project installed in the first step
  ReleaseId releaseId = new ReleaseId("org.optaplanner", "kie-server-example", "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT");
  KieContainerResource containerResource = new KieContainerResource(CONTAINER_ID, releaseId);
  kieServicesClient.createContainer(CONTAINER_ID, containerResource);
----

. Create a solver within the container.
A single container can hold multiple solvers, each of them having a unique identifier.
This is useful if you want to try out different solver configurations.
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
SolverServicesClient solverClient = kieServicesClient.getServicesClient(SolverServicesClient.class);
solverClient.createSolver(CONTAINER_ID, SOLVER_ID, SOLVER_CONFIG_XML_PATH);
----

. Submit your optimization problem
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
CloudBalance cloudBalance = loadPlanningSolution();
solverClient.solvePlanningProblem(CONTAINER_ID, SOLVER_ID, cloudBalance);
----

. Check the solver state.
At this point of time the best solution notifications are not supported yet on the client side,
you need to periodically check the solver status/best solution.
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
  SolverInstance solver = solverClient.getSolver(CONTAINER_ID, SOLVER_ID);
  if (solver.getStatus() == SolverInstance.SolverStatus.SOLVING) {
    // continue
  } else {
    CloudBalance cloudBalance = (CloudBalance) solverClient.getSolverWithBestSolution(CONTAINER_ID, SOLVER_ID).getBestSolution()
    // process the solution
  }
----

. Once you are done with the optimization, terminate the solver.
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
  solverClient.terminateSolverEarly(CONTAINER_ID, SOLVER_ID);
----

. If you don't plan to reuse the solver anymore, dispose it to free the resources on the server.
+
[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
  solverClient.disposeSolver(CONTAINER_ID, SOLVER_ID);
----

== New OptaPlanner REST API overview

The following table shows an overview of the new API introduced in version 7.0.0.Final.
All solver action URLs are normally prefixed by container URL, e.g. `http://${kie-server}/services/rest/server/containers/${container_id}`,
which is not included in the table to keep the output short.

|===
|Action |Method |URL suffix | Payload

|Register solver a|PUT a|solvers/${solver_id} |-
|Get solver a|GET a|solvers/${solver_id} |SolverInstance object
|Submit solution a|POST a|solvers/${solver_id}/state/solving |Solution object
|Get best solution a|GET a|solvers/${solver_id}/bestsolution |SolverInstance object including the best solution
|Terminate solver a|POST a|solvers/${solver_id}/state/terminating-early |-
|Dispose solver a|DELETE a|solvers/${solver_id} |-

Optionally try out KIE Workbench, which integrates with the KIE Server.
The following video demonstrates the process of setting up a Workbench example and optimizing it using the KIE Server.

== Conclusion

KIE Server provides an alternative way of optimizing your constraint satisfaction problems.
If you want to offload workload to cloud (possibly with a large amount of resources),
or you use non-Java client, KIE Server is the right pick.
