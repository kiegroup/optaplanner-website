OpenJDK 8 has several Garbage Collector algorithms, such as _Parallel GC_, _CMS_ and _G1_. Which one is the fastest?
What will happen if the default GC changes from Parallel GC in Java 8 to G1 in Java 9 (as currently proposed)?
Let's benchmark it.

== Benchmark methodology

* Run the same code 6 times with a different VM argument (`-XX:+UseSerialGC`, `-XX:+UseParallelGC`, `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC`, `-XX:ParallelCMSThreads=2`, `-XX:ParallelCMSThreads=4`, `-XX:+UseG1GC`).

* Each run takes about 55 minutes.

* Other VM arguments: `-Xmx2048M -server` +
OpenJDK version: `1.8.0_51` (currently the latest version) +
Software: `Linux version 4.0.4-301.fc22.x86_64` +
Hardware: `Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz`

* Each run solves 13 planning problems with https://www.optaplanner.org[OptaPlanner].
Each planning problem runs for 5 minutes. It starts with a 30 second JVM warm up which is discarded.

* Solving a planning problem involves *no IO* (except a few milliseconds during startup to load the input).
*A single CPU is completely saturated.*
It constantly creates many short lived objects, and the GC collects them afterwards.

* The benchmarks measure the number of scores that can be calculated per millisecond. Higher is better.
Calculating a score for a proposed planning solution is non-trivial:
it involves many calculations, including checking for conflicts between every entity and every other entity.

To reproduce these benchmarks locally, https://www.optaplanner.org/code/sourceCode.html[build optaplanner from source]
and run the main class

== Benchmark results

=== Executive summary

For your convenience, I've compared each Garbage Collector type to the default in Java 8 (Parallel GC).

The results are clear: *That default (Parallel GC) is the fastest.*

== Should Java 9 default to G1?

There is a proposal to *http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/248[make G1 the default Garbage Collector in OpenJDK9 for servers]*.
My first reaction is to *reject this proposal*:

* G1 is `17.60%` is slower on average.

* G1 is consistently slower on every use case for every dataset.

* On the biggest dataset (Machine Reassignment B10), which dwarfs any of the other datasets in size,
G1 is `34.07%` is slower.

* If the default GC differs between developer machines and servers, then developer benchmarks become less trustworthy.

On the other hand, there are a few nuances to note:

* G1 focuses on limiting GC pauses, instead of throughput.
For these use cases (with heavy calculations) GC pause length mostly doesn't matter.

* This was an (almost) single threaded benchmark.
Further benchmarking with multiple solvers in parallel or multi-threaded solving might influence results.

* G1 is recommended for a heap size of at least `6 GB`.
This benchmark used a heap size of only `2 GB` and even that size is only needed for the biggest dataset (Machine Reassignment B10).

Heavy calculations is just one of the many things that OpenJDK is used for: it's just 1 stakeholder in this community wide debate.
If other stakeholders (such as web services) prove otherwise, maybe it's worth changing the default GC.
But *show me the benchmarks* on real projects first!

== Conclusion

In Java 8, the default Garbage Collector (Parallel GC) is generally the best choice for https://www.optaplanner.org/[OptaPlanner] use cases.
