Many companies are faced with the vehicle routing problem, when they need to:

* Deliver/pick up items at multiple locations
* Or execute repairs/maintenance at multiple locations

These companies want to minimize their fuel and time usage, to reduce their costs and ecological footprint.
Sounds easy, right? _Just take the shortest route_. Unfortunately it's not that simple... Let's take a closer look.

== Minimize the distance

In Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), we need to transport items from the warehouse to the customers:

In this case, we have 7 customers across the region and 2 available vehicles stationed at the warehouse.

The shortest route to visit all these customers is this:

This optimal solution requires +210+ fuel (which includes each vehicle driving back to the warehouse).

Notice that we only use 1 vehicle. Let's continue from that assumption. +
Assumption: *An optimal VRP route uses only 1 vehicle. _(false)_*

== Vehicle capacity

In a real-world delivery/pick up scenario, each customer needs a number of items, but a vehicle's capacity to transport items is limited.

In this case, all 7 customers need 20 items and a vehicle can transport 100 items.
So a single vehicle cannot transport the 140 items of all customers.

We need to use 2 vehicles now:

This optimal solution requires +224+ fuel, which is - of course - more than the +210+ fuel of the previous solution.
The yellow truck transports 60 items and the green one 80 items.

Notice that none of the lines cross. Let's assume that's always the case. +
Assumption: *An optimal VRP route has no crossing lines. _(false)_*

Let's see what happens when some of the customers require more items than other customers.

In this case, 2 customers need 50 items and the other 5 still need 20 items.
So the previous solution is infeasible because the yellow truck would need to transport 120 items.

Now the lines do need to cross:

The optimal solution now requires even more fuel: +284+. We found a feasible solution with 2 vehicles.

So we don't seem to need any more vehicles. +
Assumption: *An optimal, feasible VRP route with n vehicles is still optimal for n+1 vehicles. _(false)_*

Let's add a 3th vehicle to disprove that:

image::vrpPresumptions07.png[]

By adding an extra vehicle, the optimal solution now uses less fuel: only +274+. This is a paradox: buying more vehicles can reduce expenses.

Notice that in both solutions above, no vehicle crosses its own line. +
Assumption: *An optimal VRP route has no crossing lines of the same color. _(false)_*

== Time Windows

In any real-world scenario, time is of the essence. Items need to be delivered on time, within the time window of each customer.

In the case above, a vehicle needs to arrive at the top left customer between 3 and 4 o'clock.
Different customers have different time windows. For example, all 4 customers on the right are flexible:
they are available between 1 and 6 o'clock. Additionally, each delivery/pick up/repair at a customer takes 1 hour to complete.

In the optimal solution, the yellow truck does cross its own line now:

image::vrpPresumptions09.png[]

In the optimal solution, the yellow truck arrives at the most left customer at 1 o'clock. An hour later it leaves for the bottom left customer at which it arrives at 2:20 (because driving takes some 20 minutes). Again an hour later it departs and arrives at its 3th customer at 3:40.

Notice how the time windows pretty much dictate the route, especially on the left side. +
Assumption: *We can focus on time windows before focusing on capacity (or vice versa). _(false)_*

Let's see what happens if the time windowed customers also need a number of items:

image::vrpPresumptions10.png[]

Given these requirements, we need to focus on the capacity and the time windows _in parallel_:

image::vrpPresumptions11.png[]

The optimal solution now puts the bottom right customer in the yellow truck, because there was no more room in the green truck.

== Conclusion

In a real-world vehicle routing problem, many assumptions fail.
Finding a good solution is hard: there are no short-cuts.
We need to be able to optimize without making assumptions.
Yet, we cannot iterate through all possible states in a brute force manner either - even on relatively small problems - because of hardware limitations.
So we need good, flexible algorithms - such as the heuristics and metaheuristics implemented in http://www.optaplanner.org[OptaPlanner] (Open Source, Java) - to solve bigger cases:
