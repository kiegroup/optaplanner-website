== How to build with Awestruct

=== On Fedora 27

Follow these instructions:

```
# Optional: clean your system first.
$ sudo dnf remove ruby rubygems rubygem-rake rubygem-bundler ruby-devel rpm-build gcc-c++ make

# Install ruby and other native RPM packages
# TODO Is rpm-build obsolete? It was once needed for ffi
# TODO Is gcc-c++ obsolete? It was needed for eventmachine
$ sudo dnf install ruby rubygems rubygem-rake rubygem-bundler ruby-devel rpm-build gcc-c++ make

$ ruby --version
ruby 2.4.3p205 (2017-12-14 revision 61247) [x86_64-linux]

# Setup the gem dependencies
$ rake setup
```

Then build the optaplanner-website (before and after your changes):

```
$ rake clean build
$ firefox _site/index.html
```

And publish your changes (if you got authorization, otherwise Jenkins will do it):

```
$ rake clean build publish
```

=== On other systems

Follow the instructions of Awestruct's http://awestruct.org/getting_started/[getting started guide].
